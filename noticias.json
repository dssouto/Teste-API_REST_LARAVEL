        "conteudo": "The government has been urged to better articulate the dangers of climate change after a report that shows the frequency of heatwaves in parts of Australia has already surpassed levels previously predicted for 2030.\nThe Climate Council report highlights that Adelaide, Melbourne and Canberra all experienced a higher average number of hot days between 2000 and 2009 than was expected to occur by 2030.\nResearch by the CSIRO forecast that Melbourne would experience an average of 12 days over 35C each year from 2030, but the average over the past decade was 12.6 days.\nAdelaide experienced an average of 25.1 days a year over 35C in this time, while Canberra surpassed this mark an average of 9.4 days.\nThe annual number of record hot days across Australia has more than doubled since 1950, according to the Climate Council report, with the south-east of the country at particular risk from more frequent heatwaves, drought and bushfires.\nLast month’s heatwave, which enveloped much of Victoria and South Australia, caused 203 heat-related deaths in Victoria alone, according to the report.\nTim Flannery, of the Climate Council, told Guardian Australia that heatwaves were the “most dangerous natural hazards in Australia”.\n“They kill hundreds of people and the fact they are accelerating beyond the predicted trends is a concern,” he said. “Heatwaves are coming earlier, they are lasting longer and they are hotter. They build up for days and before you know it, elderly people, infants and the homeless are in danger.”\nOn Monday, Tony Abbott dismissed talk of a link between climate change and drought, saying there “have always been tough times and lush times”. Last year he played down the connection between climate change and bushfire.\nFlannery said there was “clear evidence” of these links and said the government had yet to articulate the dangers of climate change and how it would combat it.\n“We’re not looking at these things in a linked-up way, we don’t seem to recognise the relationship between the number and intensity of heatwaves on bushfires, and the impact on droughts,” he said. “It’s an inconvenient truth and people don’t want to face the truth.\n“Aspects of drought conditions are clearly linked to heatwaves. I’ve spoken to farmers in NSW and they say they’ve never seen anything like the evaporation rates from dams before, due to the number of very hot days.”\nFlannery added: “Governments have a responsibility to keep Australians safe from dangers such as climate change. You need to be explicit about that threat. We have yet to see that policy yet. I mean, who knows what Direct Action is?”\nFlannery said he had a “long friendship” with Greg Hunt, the environment minister, who is regularly depicted by Labor as being sidelined within cabinet by Coalition climate sceptics.\n“Like any minister he has moments of frustration,” Flannery said. “There are clearly others in the party who are outright sceptics. The government certainly doesn’t seem to be leading the discussion on climate change.”\n“We don’t comment directly on policy issues, but it’s clear to see that we had peak emissions in Australia in 2008 and, since then, we’ve reduced emissions by one third of 1%. In the US, they had their peak in 2008 and have reduced emissions by 10.9%.\n“China has made incredible gains in renewable energy and reducing emissions intensity. We should be keeping up but we are in danger of losing sight of the frontrunners.”",

        "conteudo": "Even in the mining states of Queensland and Western Australia, most voters support phasing out subsidies for fossil fuel industries, two new polls show.\nFossil fuel companies receive about $7.7bn a year in subsidies and tax breaks – most of which is a fuel tax credit, which the industry denies is a subsidy.\nIn Western Australia, 78.1% of respondents supported either ending the subsidies now or phasing them out over time. Among undecided voters, the number was even higher, with 80.3% saying they supported either ending the subsidies or phasing them out.\nIn Queensland the figures were similar, with 76.6% supporting the immediate or gradual ending of fossil fuel subsidies and 75.9% of undecided voters agreeing.\nOnly 11.9% of voters in Western Australia and 13.2% in Queensland said they did not support ending fossil fuel subsidies.\nRelated: Insurance companies feel activists' heat for underwriting fossil fuels\nThe polling was conducted on 1 May 2016 by ReachTEL. It surveyed 1,203 people in Western Australia and 1,241 Queenslanders. It was commissioned by WWF-Australia, GetUp and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The margin of error was 3%.\nA WWF-Australia spokeswoman, Kellie Caught, said getting rid of the subsidies was “not only good for the planet, it’s also a no-brainer in terms of budget repair”.\n“Fossil fuel subsidies cause harm, stifle innovation and divest billions of dollars that would be better invested in renewable energy, job creation and the environment,” she said.\nCaught said the poll showed that the arguments made by the mining industry no longer persuaded the public.\n“The poll finds arguments made in support of continuing fossil fuel subsidies, in particular by the mining industry, no longer stack up. Everyone should do their fair share for the future of the planet and the next generation.”\nThe chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy took aim at the $5.5bn of the subsidies in fuel tax credits.\n“While most Australians pay almost 40 cents in tax for each litre of fuel they buy, big mining companies pay no tax at all on the fuel they use,” she said. “This senseless subsidy is damaging the environment and holding back innovation – it should be consigned to the rubbish bin of history.\n“The fuel tax credits scheme is a dinosaur subsidy from last century that allows multinational mining companies to effectively get their diesel for free and discourages them from making their operations more efficient.”\nThe Minerals Council maintains the fuel tax credit is a legitimate tax deduction, avoiding them paying tax twice on fuel.",

        "conteudo": "Independent energy supplier Ecotricity is among companies and organisations considering a legal challenge against the European commission decision to give approval to Hinkley Point C nuclear plant.\nAustria has already promised to fight the decision in the courts but Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, said he might stand as an “interested party” in the European court of justice to block the planned subsidy scheme for the £24bn project in Somerset.\n“This is a mad decision by Brussels and a patriotic issue for us. The financial support agreed for Hinkley would be an enormous burden for the country and there is the costs of decommissioning on top of that. Where is the money going to come from?” said Vince, whose company builds windfarms as well as supplying gas and electricity.\nJeremy Leggett, who founded Solarcentury, also voiced his dismay. “The days when the nuclear industry could impose whatever tilted playing field it wanted on renewables are gone,” he said. “They are dealing with huge global industries now that last year put more generation capacity online globally than all fossil fuels and nuclear combined. These are not likely to soak up nuclear nonsense without a fight any more.”\nEcotricity builds windfarms and Solacentury installs solar panels. Both are worried that the government has capped the amount of money being made available for low-carbon generators. They fear that nuclear will suck up most of the available money.\nPaul Dorfman, a senior research associate at the Energy Institute at University College, London, said there was a groundswell of opinion among renewable energy companies and associations in Britain and Europe that something should be done: “We are profoundly disappointed that the outgoing European commission administration has decided to rush through this decision to approve state aid to Hinkley Point C without giving the new commission the opportunity to review and reflect on a decision which will set a significant precedent on energy and competition policy. That this decision has been taken in undue haste only strengthens the grounds for and likely success of a legal challenge.”\nThe commission announced last Wednesday that it was convinced by arguments from the UK government that the “contracts for difference” aid scheme was justified to encourage EDF of France to construct the new atomic plant. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has agreed that EDF will be able to obtain £92 per megawatt hour – double the current cost of energy – over a 35-year period. The money will be recovered via energy customers’ bills but the length of the contract is much more generous than anything agreed for wind or solar power.\nEd Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, described the Brussels decision as an important step on the road to Britain’s first new nuclear power station and insisted it was a good deal for consumers.\n“While there is much work still to do before a final contract can be signed, today’s announcement is a boost to our efforts to ensure Britain has secure, affordable low carbon electricity in the 2020s,” he said.\nDECC argues that rising gas and carbon prices will make nuclear power a future good bet for consumers at a time when old coal and atomic stations are coming off line owing to old age or other reasons.\nThe decision to give the green light to Hinkley surprised many, as in January the European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, who retires on 1 November, had earlier overseen a heavily critical report on the subsidy arrangements proposed by DECC. But he said he had changed his minds after making some changes to the original proposal.\nEDF says it can build Hinkley Point for £16bn. But the European commission says the cost by the time it is meant to become operational in 2023 is more likely to be £24bn.",

        "conteudo": "The National Audit Office has begun an investigation into the controversial subsidy regime for the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, a week after Brussels approved taxpayer support for the project.\nThe financial watchdog, which scrutinises public spending on behalf of parliament, said it would be checking whether the guaranteed prices of £92 a megawatt hour – double the current cost of electricity – represented “value for money”.\nThe NAO move, which follows pressure from a House of Commons committee, puts pressure on the government but has pleased green groups which believe nuclear is getting preferential treatment over windfarms.\n“Our work will cover the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s commercial approach to securing this deal and the proposed terms of the contract, to report to parliament on value for money and the resulting risks which the Department must manage,” said the NAO in a formal statement.\n“We will also wish to identify lessons learned to inform decisions on future ‘contracts for difference’,” it added, referring to the new funding mechanism for Hinkley and other low-carbon energy projects. Last week the European commission approved the subsidy scheme, citing government concessions on the project’s funding structure.\nThe parliamentary environmental audit committee (EAC) had called this week for the NAO to hold a full inquiry into the government’s deal. Joan Walley, the committee’s chair, said the “process and outcome” of the deal, as well as whether it represents value for money, should be investigated by the UK authorities now that it has been approved by Brussels.\nA DECC spokesperson said: “This month the commission agreed that Hinkley represents a good deal for both bill-payers and investors. It’s perfectly ordinary for the NAO to look into large investment contracts and we will be working with them as we move closer to finalising the contract. We will not go ahead with any contract unless it is good value for money.”\nJohn Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, welcomed the NAO decision, saying: “The stitch-up concocted in Brussels will see two generations of UK consumers locked into paying billions of pounds to a mainly state-owned corporation in France in order to bankroll an outdated and risky source of energy.\n“This is an extraordinarily bad use of public funds and ministers will have a tough time trying to justify it. This money would be better spent on clean technologies and energy saving measures, which don’t leave a legacy of radioactive waste and benefit the UK economy while reducing carbon emissions.”\nThe decision by the NAO comes just days after Ecotricity and other renewable energy firms said they were considering a legal challenge against the Hinkley financing package.\nEcotricity, a wind farm operator, and Solarcentury, a solar power business, said the European commission was wrong to conclude the Hinkley aid would not be detrimental to other low-carbon power producers. Hinkley, a new set of reactors planned for Somerset, has been set a funding scheme paid for by consumers that will last for 35 years, much longer than any previous schemes enjoyed by renewables companies.\nBut EDF, which will build and Hinkley Point C, has defended the funding. It said: “Last week’s approval from the European commission demonstrates that agreements between the government and EDF are fair and balanced for consumers and investors alike.”",

        "conteudo": "Britain's green ambitions have been dealt a blow as a big six energy company has pulled the plug on one of the world's largest offshore windfarms, with the political storm enveloping the industry threatening the multibillion-pound investments needed to meet emissions targets and head off a looming capacity crunch.\nWeeks after warning that the government was treating environmental subsidies as a \"political football\", the German-owned RWE npower is pulling out of the £4bn Atlantic Array project in the Bristol Channel because the economics do not stack up.\nThe move comes as figures show that energy firms reaped a 77% increase in profits per customer last year, due to bill increases that the big six say are partly due to government green levies.\nThe shelving of the Atlantic Array is a setback for the government, which is banking on bigger windfarms in deeper waters to help provide low-carbon power. The RWE cancellation is the first axing of a Round 3 windfarm – schemes such as those in Dogger Bank, Hornsea and East Anglia, which are supposed to help the government meet a target of generating 15% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. It will also raise further concerns about investors being frightened away by political rows and policy uncertainty.\nThe Renewable Energy Association (REA), which lobbies for more low-carbon power, said government infighting over subsidies was causing deep uncertainty in the industry.\nAhead of next week's autumn statement, the chancellor is looking to transfer the £1.6bn cost of the energy companies obligation (Eco) and the smaller warm home discount to the taxpayer, removing the burden from household bills.\n\"We need assurances from George Osborne in the autumn statement about where we stand,\" said a spokesman for the REA. \"Nick Clegg says one thing about the green levies, Michael Fallon [the energy minister] another.\"\nLast week David Cameron was reported to have talked about the need to get rid of \"green crap\" from energy bills. Number 10 said it did not recognise the phrase but did not deny the sentiment. Peter Atherton, a leading energy analyst, warned last week that investment in power generation was \"killed stone dead\" until the next election by Ed Miliband's call for a price freeze and government delays in introducing promised electricity market reform.\nThe political and public environment for power companies is set to become more hostile following the publication of figures on Monday showing that the average profit per customer for the big six rose from £30 to £53 last year. The industry watchdog said the rise was due to higher bills and increased energy use during a harsh winter, not due to cost reduction.\nRWE indicated that the government might have to raise green subsidies – and thus increase bills or the burden on the taxpayer – after admitting that technical difficulties had pushed the price up so far that it could not be justified under the current subsidy regime.\n\"This is not a decision we have taken lightly; however, given the technological challenges and market conditions, now is not the right time for RWE to continue to progress with this project,\" said Paul Cowling, director of offshore wind at RWE Innogy.\nThe Atlantic Array would have provided clean energy for almost 1m homes and provided thousands of jobs in the construction phase. Cowling insisted RWE remained committed to offshore wind and would be proceeding with a range of other projects off the coast of Britain.\nRichard Sandford, head of European projects offshore at RWE, also denied that the Atlantic Array was dropped in a bid to save money at the German-based company. \"This really is project-specific and not at all down to other considerations. We are still proceeding with schemes like Galloper and Triton Knoll, off the east coast of the country.\"\nBut RWE has already pulled out of a £350m nuclear-power project, is selling its DEA North Sea oil business and last week disposed of part of its UK gas and electricity supply arm. Developers have been warning for some time that they would need more subsidies from the government if ministers were to realise low-carbon energy targets.\nThe demise of the 240-turbine Atlantic Array will be welcomed by Geoffrey Cox, the local Conservative MP for Torridge and West Devon, who has been campaigning against the scheme. He and his supporters believe the project for 220-metre high turbines is unsightly. The plans to build it nine miles off the coast in the Bristol Channel were also rejected by North Devon council in September.\nBut the pullout will also raise concerns about the investment landscape in Britain for energy companies such as RWE, which have been under ferocious attack by politicians, regulator and the public.\nThe Crown Estate warned at the weekend that some Round 3 schemes might never see the light of day and insisted this was to be expected.\nHuub den Rooijen, the Crown Estate's head of offshore wind, said on Mondaythere would be further \"attrition\" to come. \"Paradoxically, this is a positive development because it provides greater clarity to key stakeholders such as supply chain and consenting bodies, and brings greater focus to the investment opportunities.\"\nThe Crown Estate, which has control over most of the seabed around the UK, has just given the go-ahead to Statoil to experiment with a floating windfarm off the coast of Scotland. The Hywind scheme is seen as important because it could help reduce costs offshore.\nRenewable energy companies have promised to try to reduce offshore wind costs by 30% through a raft of measures as government ministers are under pressure to reduce public subsidies.\nRWE has declined to put a cost on developing the Atlantic Array but said it was more expensive than the Gwynt y Môr project off Wales, which will cost £2bn and is about half the size.\nThe Departtment of Energy and Climate Change said: The decision not to proceed with the development is a matter for RWE. It was made on purely technical grounds and reflects the many complex challenges of constructing offshore windfarms.\n\"The UK still expects to deploy significant amounts of offshore wind by 2020 and we remain well placed to meet our 2020 renewable energy target.",

The Buchan Deep project will see five turbines with a combined power of 30 megawatts installed by the Norwegian oil company Statoil off the coast of Aberdeenshire in 100 metres of water.\nApproval comes as rising fuel bills and a wavering political commitment to developing a low-carbon economy is leading some energy companies to consider cutting back on offshore wind.\nEnergy and climate change minister Michael Fallon said putting turbines on floating platforms rather than concrete bases in the seabed \"underlines the dynamism of the sector\". The scheme follows a trend set in the North Sea oil and gas business, where floating production platforms drastically reduced the cost of hydrocarbons and made it possible to move into deeper waters.\nThe wind industry has set itself a target of cutting its costs by 30% and the Buchan Deep scheme is pencilled in as a major contributor if the trials go well. The Crown Estate, which manages most of the seabed around the UK, says it worked with Statoil for more than two years before approving the project.\n\"Investing in new technologies will be crucial to unlocking offshore wind potential over the long term while we focus on the current development pipeline,\" said Huub den Rooijen, head of offshore wind at the Crown Estate.\nFallon said: \"This innovative project will lead to the construction of the first floating offshore windfarms in the UK. This underlines the UK's attractiveness as the number one destination for offshore wind development.\"\nStatoil, which makes the bulk of its earnings from selling oil and gas, has been experimenting with one floating turbine, the Hywind, off the coast of Norway since 2009. The Scottish project allows the company to test the system as an \"array\", or farm, to see how it will work with half a dozen turbines operating simultaneously in close proximity. Statoil has not given a final investment approval to the Buchan Deep scheme but called the go-ahead from the Crown Estate a significant milestone towards getting a floating farm up and running.\n\"We look forward to a progressed dialogue with key stakeholders in Scotland, including communities, the local supply chain and the authorities,\" said Siri Espedal Kindem, Statoil's senior vice-president for renewable energy. \"We will continue to mature the Hywind pilot towards a final investment decision, by conducting marine surveys and concept studies in order to demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility.\"\nThe need for cheaper solutions comes as the government's climate change adviser warned that offshore windfarms may not be built unless subsidies are increased by the government.\nThe committee on climate change wrote to Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, in September saying that \"required investment\" was at risk unless further financial support was provided. A group of industry developers have made the same point to government.\nBut ministers believe it is up to industry to find ways of reducing the costs of offshore wind, and in late June unveiled proposed reductions in subsidy levels for the rest of the decade.\nDen Rooijen, a former Shell oil executive, is optimistic that costs can be cut and that the sector will continue to grow, but admits that the UK is likely to see a retrenchment from the estimated 40,000MW (40 gigawatts) of projects that some originally believed could be possible.\n\"The full 40GW is not all going to be developed – certainly not over the near to medium term – and the consequence of that is [that] it is really important that the industry carries forward the best projects in the pipeline,\" he said.\nIncreased knowledge about seabed and weather conditions for foundations and cable costs allowed project developers to select which schemes to take forward and which not, he said.\nLast month, offshore wind provided 5% of national electricity consumption from around 24 farms producing 3.6GW. There is now, in total, more than 5GW – enough to power 4m homes – in operation or under construction, at an estimated cost close to £15bn.\nThe industry grew by 80% as four very large offshore projects became operational during the last 18 months: Greater Gabbard, Gunfleet Sands III, Sheringham Shoal and the London Array off the coast of Kent, currently the biggest offshore windfarm in the world, generating 630MW of power.\nMaria McCaffery, chief executive of trade body RenewableUK, stressed this month that the sector was providing jobs as well as low-carbon energy security: \"Tens of thousands more will be joining the industry over the rest of this decade as we build out the rest of the projects in the pipeline – as long as government policy is supportive and provides the right framework for one of this country's greatest modern industrial and environmental success stories to reach its full potential.\"",

        "conteudo": "The UK government has become embroiled in a row over financial support for fossil fuel companies after announcing a $1bn (£660m) funding package involving Pemex, the Mexican state oil group.\nGreenpeace said the move to provide credit for “dirty” energy projects under the UK Export Finance (UKEF) scheme flew counter to the government’s commitments to fighting climate change.\nThe Tories and Lib Dems pledged in 2010 that export finance would be used to champion British companies that developed and exported innovative green technologies around the world, “instead of supporting investment in dirty fossil fuel energy production”.\n“The truth is that the ‘greenest government ever’ has spent the last five years bankrolling some of the dirtiest energy developments on the planet, from Russian coal mining to the Saudi oil industry,” said Lawrence Carter, a Greenpeace UK energy campaigner.\nRelated: UK loaned £1.7bn to foreign fossil fuel projects despite pledge\n“Our ministers should stop acting like the merchant bankers of climate change and start using export finance to promote the cutting-edge clean technologies that are reshaping energy markets the world over.”\nThe financing agreement was revealed during a visit to Aberdeen by Matthew Hancock, the UK energy minister, alongside Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto who is on a wider state trip to the UK.\nMexico’s energy system is undergoing significant reform and Nieto was visiting Scotland to speak to energy leaders across the business and education sectors, as well as signing agreements with the UK government for greater collaboration in the areas of energy and climate change.\n“This visit today by President Peña Nieto to the UK’s energy capital cements the already close links between our two countries and heralds an era of closer collaboration in energy,” said Hancock.\n“The government of Mexico expects $50bn of investment by 2018 in the wake of its energy reforms – boosting the economy and creating jobs while rejuvenating production,” he added.\nRelated: UK spent 300 times more on fossil fuels than clean energy despite green pledge\nOver the course of the parliament, UK Export Finance, a small government department, has given financial support worth only £3.6m to green energy projects around the world, it was revealed last month through data released to the Guardian under freedom of information rules.\nA spokesperson for UKEF said the memorandum of understanding with Mexico was to work “towards” a line of credit and was not a firm commitment at this stage, or an investment.\n“UK Export Finance’s role is to provide financial support to UK exporters, primarily through providing insurance to exporters and guarantees to banks that enable them to take advantage of overseas contracts. As part of that, we have a dedicated Environmental Advisory team which reviews the environmental, social and human rights issues of projects covered by the OECD’s Common Approaches, prior to the department agreeing to provide support.”\nNieto was being introduced in Aberdeen to executives from BP and Shell, both of which have made no secret of their desire to enter the Mexican energy sector, which has been largely closed to foreign firms.\nThere is considerable excitement in western oil capitals about the onshore shale prospects that exist in Mexico. Equally, there are unexplored deep-water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, across the territorial dividing line from large US discoveries.",

        "conteudo": "This weekend, the Liberal Democrats will gather in Liverpool for their annual party conference. They may be in government, but Nick Clegg's party is behind in the polls. How successful has the party's agreement with the Conservatives and the Liberal-Conservative coalition been so far?\nWith nearly 400 pledges in the Coalition Agreement, we have divided the policies by party origin (ie, whose idea was it?).\nA small proportion of the Coalition pledges have already been completed, while the majority are in progress in some form, whether through a prospective bill or an upcoming review from a specially appointed commission. Meanwhile, there are a significant number of policies lacking any action or without information, and some referred for consideration during the five-year the Parliament. Finally, there are several proposals which are either in a state of failure or facing serious difficulties in the House.\nThe key results we found are:\n• 207 pledges are in progress, with 41 having been completed\n• In 57 cases we couldn't find any evidence of progress at all\n• 79 are in limbo, although some are subject to lengthy reviews\n• Six have failed\nCertain areas are clearly dominated by the Liberal Democrats, notably civil liberties, while a number of other areas are a landslide for Conservative policy. Some areas, like foreign policy and defence, look to be completely Conservative, but it is likely that this is more due to omissions in the Liberal Democrat manifesto than contrasting ideas.\nMuch of this is subjective - see the notes in the attached spreadsheet, which aim to explain the current position of Government policies.\nThe full spreadsheet is below. What can you do with it?\nData summary The coalition agreement audited\nCategory Details What's happened? Party origin Pledge\nBANKING We will reform the banking system to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis, to promote a competitive economy, to sustain the recovery and to protect and sustain jobs. Both in progress\nBANKING We will introduce a banking levy and seek a detailed agreement on implementation. Both in progress Banking levy in conjunction with France & Germany will come into operation in January 2011. Expected to raise £1.1bn in 2011-12, £2.3bn in 2012-13, £2.5bn in 2013-14. However TUC predicted £5-8bn – therefore levy weaker than predicted.\nBANKING We will bring forward detailed proposals for robust action to tackle unacceptable bonuses in the financial services sector; in developing these proposals, we will ensure they are effective in reducing risk. LD wait and see No mention of a tax on bonuses in the budget – although possibility of a financial transactions tax (FTT) is raised and the FSA is tasked with considering more stringent requirements on the deferral and award of variable pay, examining mechanisms for strengthening the link between incentives and long-term performance, and considering how to vary capital requirements to offset risk in remuneration practices. 12/7/10 After criticism of being soft on the banks, Mark Hoban said the Govt was considering a permanent tax on the pay & profits of banks (FTT) but decision yet.\nBANKING We want the banking system to serve business, not the other way round. We will bring forward detailed proposals to foster diversity in financial services, promote mutuals and create a more competitive banking industry. LD ? No sign of action to encourage diversity within the banking sector.\nBANKING We will develop effective proposals to ensure the flow of credit to viable SMEs. This will include consideration of both a major loan guarantee scheme and the use of net lending targets for the nationalised banks.

Oct 2011 deadline to address market failures in provision of bank lending & equity finance to viable SMEs. 16/6/10 Bank of England given the power to look at lending policies of individual banks.\nBANKING We will take steps to reduce systemic risk in the banking system and will establish an independent commission to investigate the complex issue of separating retail and investment banking in a sustainable way; while recognising that this will take time to get right, the commission will be given an initial time frame of one year to report. LD in progress Vince Cable wants to separation of retail and investment banks – George Osbourne announced the creation of a banking commission led by Sir John Vickers which will report by Sept 2011. BUT Nick Clegg admitted there was a “lively debate” within Govt & Cable admitted that the commission might not back a split softening his position. Osbourne clearly in charge. Possible u-turn!\nBANKING We will reform the regulatory system to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. We will bring forward proposals to give the Bank of England control of macro-prudential regulation and oversight of micro-prudential regulation. Con Done The new regulatory framework creates a Bank of England Financial Policy Committee for macro-prudential regulation and a Prudential Regulation Authority as a Bank subsidiary, with the Bank governor and a deputy governor in charge. This replaces the FSA, whose abolition had been opposed by the Lib Dems before the election.\nBANKING We rule out joining or preparing to join the European Single Currency for the duration of this agreement. Con Done\nBANKING We will work with the Bank of England to investigate how the process of including housing costs in the CPI measure of inflation can be accelerated. ? wait and see George Osborne has said he will 'welcome' the Bank of England governor’s views on housing costs can be included in the CPI measure of inflation, though when the first unveiling of this index might be is not yet clear\nBANKING We will create Britain’s first free national financial advice service, which will be funded in full from a new social responsibility levy on the financial services sector. Con ?\nBANKING We take white collar crime as seriously as other crime, so we will create a single agency to take on the work of tackling serious economic crime that is currently done by, among others, the Serious Fraud Office, Financial Services Authority and Office of Fair Trading. Con (not in Manifesto) in progress The coalition is working on plans for an Economic Crime Agency. But in the financial crisis, the cost may be prohibitive – it may be cancelled if it costs too much.\nBUSINESS We will cut red tape by introducing a ‘one-in, one-out’ rule whereby no new regulation is brought in without other regulation being cut by a greater amount. LD Done The rule began operation on 1 September 2010. 5/8/10 Announcement by Vince Cable - Ministers seek to introduce new regulations on business/third sector, with a view to expand it. Govt has agreed to a set of Principles of Regulation that Government departments must apply when considering new regulations. Govt has asked the independent Regulatory Policy Committee to externally scrutinise evidence & analysis on new proposals & has provided the opportunity for public and businesses to consult on onerous regulations.\nBUSINESS We will end the culture of ‘tick-box’ regulation, and instead target inspections on high-risk organisations through co-regulation and improving professional standards. ? wait and see The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills draft structural reform plan says a statement on 'tick box' regulation and a co-regulation plan (which will focus inspections on high-risk organisations) will come in January 2011\nBUSINESS We will impose ‘sunset clauses’ on regulations and regulators to ensure that the need for each regulation is regularly reviewed. LD in progress BIS draft structural reform plan sets out plans to introduce 'sunset clauses' on regulations (automatic expiry) from June 2010, with legislation from Nov 2010 – Nov 2011.\nBUSINESS We will review IR 35, as part of a wholesale review of all small business taxation, and seek to replace it with simpler measures that prevent tax avoidance but do not place undue administrative burdens or uncertainty on the self-employed, or restrict labour market flexibility. ?

LD in progress Postal Services Bill in the Queen's speech allows the sale of part of Royal Mail (plans originally drawn up by Lord Mandelson. 10/9/10 Vince Cable announces full privatisation of Royal Mail (further than Labour and Coalition plans), includes offering shares to employees. The Coalition Agreement just said “an injection of private capital” with 49% of RM sold off. Govt now recognises an “urgent need for new capital”. Total privatisation preferable but all options open. Govt remains “fully committed” to retaining full ownership of Post Office network & takes on responsibility for pension fund. Enabling bill to be introduced later in the Autumn.\nBUSINESS We will seek to ensure a level playing field between small and large retailers by enabling councils to take competition issues into account when drawing up their local plans to shape the direction and type of new retail development. LD ? No sign of action. Watering down of LD manifesto which required a local competition test for all planning applications for new retail developments.\nBUSINESS We will give the public the opportunity to challenge the worst regulations. Con Done The Your Freedom website unveiled by Nick Clegg has a dual focus - allowing the public to name both laws they want repealed and regulations they want rolled back. The business department will also hold regional meetings with SMEs from October 2010 to July 2011. The Conservative Manifesto gave the opportunity for the public to force the worst regulations to be repealed.\nBUSINESS We will review employment and workplace laws, for employers and employees, to ensure they maximise flexibility for both parties while protecting fairness and providing the competitive environment required for enterprise to thrive. ? ?\nBUSINESS We will make it easier for people to set up new enterprises by cutting the time it takes to start a new business.

BIS draft structural reform plan sets a deadline for publishing the first proposals. A review on existing EU rules is underway.\nBUSINESS We will support the creation of Local Enterprise Partnerships – joint local authority-business bodies brought forward by local authorities themselves to promote local economic development – to replace Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). These may take the form of the existing RDAs in areas where they are popular. Both in progress RDAs are to have their functions transferred to other bodies & assets disposed of ahead of formal dissolution in April 2012. LEPs, created by the localism bill (Nov 2011?), will begin work at the same time.\nBUSINESS We will take steps to improve the competitiveness of the UK tourism industry, recognising the important part it plays in our national economy. ? in progress Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, has announced a £1bn fund to promote Britain as a tourist destination as a permanent legacy of the Olympic Games. David Cameron has also said measures to help the industry would be speeding up the process of getting visitors' visas for the UK in India and China\nCIVIL LIBERTIES We will implement a full programme of measures to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties and roll back state intrusion. Both in progress The pledge was made by Nick Clegg in his first speech as deputy PM.

Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for alternatives. We will immediately play a strong role in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, and press for continued progress on multilateral disarmament. Con in progress / done The defence secretary, Liam Fox, has initiated a Trident renewal 'value for money' exercise, to try to make it less expensive. Trident is thought to cost between £14bn and £20bn over a decade, with those costs starting low and becoming larger towards the end. The MoD has lost the battle with the Treasury over who will pay for it. Britain signed a deal requiring the world's five self-confessed nuclear states to speed up arms reductions and to support a 2012 conference to discuss a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said Britain had pushed hard for a deal, not least by making public the extent of its nuclear arsenal for the first time\nDEFENCE We will aim to reduce Ministry of Defence running costs by at least 25%.

We have created an independent Office for Budget Responsibility to make new forecasts of growth and borrowing for this emergency budget. Both Done George Osborne's first budget raised VAT, froze child benefit and vowed to cut non-protected departments' spending by up to 25%. The chancellor said the government would be running a 0.3% surplus in four years. The Office of Budget Responsibility (Con policy) was created on an interim basis in one of Osborne's first acts as chancellor. A bill in the Queen's speech will put it on a permanent statutory footing. Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott described the OBR as 'a low-key version of Labour's 1997 initiative, an independent Bank of England'\nDEFICIT REDUCTION* We will make modest cuts of £6 billion to non-front-line services within the financial year 2010/11, subject to advice from the Treasury and the Bank of England on their feasibility and advisability. A proportion of these savings can be used to support jobs. Con Done George Osborne and David Laws announced immediate cuts of £6.2bn with £500m 'recycled'.

Not only high earners, but middle earners and even a family where both parents earn only slightly more than the full-time national minimum wage will be affected. Conservative pledge to restrict child trust fund cuts to higher earners, it was broken in the first weeks of the coalition (government spin doctors may disagree). Payments will be reduced 80% from August and ended altogether in January 2011. The abolition represented a win for the Liberal Democrats, who proposed it in their manifesto.\nDEFICIT REDUCTION* We will create strong financial discipline at all levels of government and place an obligation on public servants to manage taxpayers’ money wisely. Con in progress\nDEFICIT REDUCTION* We will reduce the number and cost of quangos. Both in progress Cutting quangos ran through both party manifestos. The public bodies bill will provide the legislation: it is scheduled to be introduced in November 2010, receive royal assent in July 2011, and either abolish quangos or return them to departments from June 2010 (non-statutory function) to January 2012 (statutory function)\nENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE We will push for the EU to demonstrate leadership in tackling international climate change, including by supporting an increase in the EU emission reduction target to 30% by 2020.

Con in progress A Welsh badger cull was stopped after the appeal court ruled the Welsh government had not been specific enough about its scope. The coalition has published proposals to license farmers to kill badgers. The cull could start in May 2011 and as many as 6,000 badgers would be shot in the first year but legal challenges are to be expected – a Welsh badger cull was stopped after the appeal court earlier this year.\nENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS We will promote high standards of farm animal welfare. We will end the testing of household products on animals and work to reduce the use of animals in scientific research. We will promote responsible pet ownership by introducing effective codes of practice under the Animal Welfare Act, and will ensure that enforcement agencies target irresponsible owners of dangerous dogs.

Con Done Britain opposed a lifting of the ban at the most recent International Whaling Commission talks. The US, New Zealand and some green groups however supported it in return for whaling countries cutting the number of whales killed.

The home secretary, Theresa May, said the judgment gave a legal basis for a change in the assessment of asylum claims based on sexuality\nEQUALITIES We will use our relationships with other countries to push for unequivocal support for gay rights and for UK civil partnerships to be recognised internationally. ? in progress The home secretary, Theresa May, announced a cross-government LGBT workplan that included lobbying for international recognition of UK civil partnerships.

Con wait and see Europe divides the two coalition parties. A 'positive' European policy is safely vague and non-committal. The foreign secretary, William Hague, has, however, been less hostile to the EU than some in his party would want. One of his European policies is to increase the numbers of UK nationals in Brussels jobs\nEUROPE We will ensure that there is no further transfer of sovereignty or powers over the course of the next Parliament. We will examine the balance of the EU’s existing competences and will, in particular, work to limit the application of the Working Time Directive in the United Kingdom. ? in progress A European communities (amendment) referendum lock bill extends the pledge to the use of 'ratchet clauses' in EU treaties, which can be used to transfer powers without treaty negotiations. It says it will require a referendum for major ones and primary legislation for the others. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills draft structural reform plan says negotiations run from September 2010 to March 2011. The European Commission will publish proposals to amend it in spring 2011\nEUROPE We will amend the 1972 European Communities Act so that any proposed future treaty that transferred areas of power, or competences, would be subject to a referendum on that treaty – a ‘referendum lock’. We will amend the 1972 European Communities Act so that the use of any /passerelle/ would require primary legislation.

Britain will not participate in the establishment of any European Public Prosecutor. Con in progress Happening - but not to universal acclaim. Theresa May's opt in to the European Investigation Order (so police can investigate suspects in other EU states) was criticised by members of her own party. The coalition has also opted out of a directive on human trafficking, saying it will review later what action to take. Public prosecutor ?\nEUROPE We support the further enlargement of the EU. ? in progress A European communities (amendment) referendum lock bill says treaties that admit new members will not be subject to referendums. David Cameron used his first trip to Turkey to warn France and Germany against trying to block or stall the country joining the EU\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will maintain the goal of ending child poverty in the UK by 2020. LD in progress The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, has re-stated the coalition's commitment to tackling child poverty. George Osborne announced in the budget a £150 increase in the child element of the child tax credit and said his proposals overall would not increase measured child poverty\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will reform the administration of tax credits to reduce fraud and overpayments. LD wait and see The Liberal Democrat manifesto pledged to fix payments for six months to end the 'rollercoaster' of payments and repayments, though Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has not ruled out scrapping them\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will bring forward plans to reduce the couple penalty in the tax credit system as we make savings from our welfare reform plans. Con ?\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We support the provision of free nursery care for pre-school children, and we want that support to be provided by a diverse range of providers, with a greater gender balance in the early years workforce. Both ?\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will take Sure Start back to its original purpose of early intervention, increase its focus on the neediest families, and better involve organisations with a track record of supporting families. We will investigate ways of ensuring that providers are paid in part by the results they achieve.

Con ?\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will publish serious case reviews, with identifying details removed. LD Done The Khyra Ishaq serious case review is published. Children's minister Tim Loughton has said the serious case review into the death of Baby P will also be among the first to be released\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will review the criminal records and vetting and barring regime and scale it back to common sense levels. Both in progress The home secretary, Theresa May, stopped the vetting of up to nine million people who frequently work with children ahead of a review to scale back the scheme to 'common sense' proportions reporting in December 2010. The Liberal Democrats had proposed a portable record\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will crack down on irresponsible advertising and marketing, especially to children. We will also take steps to tackle the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. Both in progress The Liberal Democrat manifesto made specific mention of the role of airbrushing in developing negative body images among young people. Lynne Featherstone, the equalities minister, will convene a series of discussions this autumn with the fashion industry, including magazine editors and advertising executives\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will encourage shared parenting from the earliest stages of pregnancy – including the promotion of a system of flexible parental leave. Both in progress The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills draft structural reform plan says it is developing proposals and consulting up to January 2011. Legislation, if necessary, will be published in April 2011\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will put funding for relationship support on a stable, long-term footing, and make sure that couples are given greater encouragement to use existing relationship support. Con ?\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN We will conduct a comprehensive review of family law in order to increase the use of mediation when couples do break up, and to look at how best to provide greater access rights to non-resident parents and grandparents. Con ?\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will take forward our shared resolve to safeguard the UK’s national security and support our Armed Forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Con in progress Chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told the Commons he had not cut 'spending on crucial equipment for military operations in Afghanistan'. The government has since insisted that aid spending in the developing world must make the 'maximum possible contribution' to national security\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will push for peace in the Middle East, with a secure and universally recognised Israel living alongside a sovereign and viable Palestinian state. Both Done Continuation of existing government policy. On a visit from the Israeli PM, Binyamin Netanyahu, in May 2010 David Cameron re-stated British support for a two state solution and William Hague told Hillary Clinton the UK backed the latest round of US-proposed talks\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will work to establish a new ‘special relationship’ with India and seek closer engagement with China, while standing firm on human rights in all our bilateral relationships. Con in progress The coalition is certainly trying. David Cameron led the largest ministerial delegation to the sub-continent in recent history. However, this is not entirely in British hands - the Indian government may, for example, prefer to pursue enhanced relations with other nations, such as the US. George Osborne's first overseas visit as chancellor was to China. He said it was 'testimony to the importance the British government attaches to the relationship'. The coalition is continuing UK policy on human rights dialogue with China.\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will maintain a strong, close and frank relationship with the United States. Con in progress It all depends on what 'strong, close and frank' means, plus the added complication of the USA also having some say. On the eve of his first White House visit, however, David Cameron attempted to frame what could be said to be a more mature relationship, saying he had 'never understood the British anxiety about whether it will survive'. DC - \"I am hard-headed and realistic about US-UK relations. I understand that we are the junior partner\"\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We want to strengthen the Commonwealth as a focus for promoting democratic values and development. Con ?\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will work to promote stability in the Western Balkans. Con ?\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will support concerted international efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Both Done Downing Street briefing papers released with the Queen's speech said Britain would continue to push for sanctions and EU efforts to involve Iran in negotiations - the EU has since agreed a tougher set of sanctions than the UN. The coalition agreement however lacks the Liberal Democrats' rejection of military action\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We support reform of the UN Security Council, including permanent seats for Japan, India, Germany, Brazil and African representation. Con ?\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will work to intensify our cultural, educational, commercial and diplomatic links with many nations beyond Europe and North America to strengthen the UK’s relations with the fastest-growing areas of the world economy. Con in progress The ministerial delegation to India was one of the first attempts to build links beyond Europe and North America.\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS We will never condone the use of torture. Both Done The pledge was strengthened with the announcement by David Cameron of a review into allegations of UK complicity in torture with Sir Peter Gibson, a retired barrister and judge, at its head. This represents a win for the Liberal Democrats, who made such a judge-led inquiry a manifesto promise\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will require public bodies to publish online the job titles of every member of staff and the salaries and expenses of senior officials paid more than the lowest salary permissible in Pay Band 1 of the Senior Civil Service pay scale, and organograms that include all positions in those bodies. Con in progress The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan sets a September 2010 deadline for public bodies to publish online the job titles of every member of staff and the salaries and expenses of senior officials\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will require anyone paid more than the Prime Minister in the centrally funded public sector to have their salary signed off by the Treasury. Con Done Shortly before he resigned, former Treasury chief secretary David Laws said the maximum pay that could be granted without his approval was £142,500. But the policy cannot be fully implemented until senior civil service posts become vacant, and new packages signed\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will regulate lobbying through introducing a statutory register of lobbyists and ensuring greater transparency. LD in progress According to a Commons written answer, ministers are to publish plans in the autumn. The register was a Liberal Democrat policy and re-stated in Nick Clegg's first speech as deputy PM. A political reform draft structural reform plan says legislation will be introduced in November 2011\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will also pursue a detailed agreement on limiting donations and reforming party funding in order to remove big money from politics. Both wait and see Downing Street briefing papers released with the Queen's speech re-stated that the government will 'pursue a detailed agreement'. The standards on public life committee has held a hearing. A political reform draft structural reform plan sets from 2011 to 2014 to pursue the agreement\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will strengthen the powers of Select Committees to scrutinise major public appointments. Con in progress The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan says it is at present working on plans with the leader of the House. George Osborne's offer to the Treasury select committee of a veto on the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility may be taken as an indication of intention.\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will introduce new protections for whistleblowers in the public sector. ? wait and see The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan says this is 'ongoing' from June 2010. No detailed policies or protections so far\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will take steps to open up government procurement and reduce costs; and we will publish government ICT contracts online. Both wait and see The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan says it will develop a new approach to ICT procurement from November 2010 to March 2011 that will enable greater use of small and medium enterprises\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will create a level playing field for open-source software and will enable large ICT projects to be split into smaller components. Both in progress Open source software features in both manifestos. The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan terms the creation of a level playing field for such software as 'ongoing'. The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan sets June 2010 to August 2010 as a timeframe for publishing guidance 'on the aspiration to reduce the scale of large ICT projects', though the Cabinet Office has moved the deadline to September 2010.\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will require full, online disclosure of all central government spending and contracts over £25,000. Con in progress The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan anticipates the publication of all central government spending over £25,000 by November 2010\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will create a new ‘right to data’ so that government-held datasets can be requested and used by the public, and then published on a regular basis. Con wait and see The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan sets a 2013 deadline for a generalised 'right to data', working in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice on legislation. We need to see more detail before moving it to a new categorisation\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will require all councils to publish meeting minutes and local service and performance data. Con in progress The Department for Communities and Local Government draft structural reform plan says initial expectations for local authorities regarding data transparency were set out in June 2010. The Cabinet Office is working with the DCLG\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will require all councils to publish items of spending above £500, and to publish contracts and tender documents in full. Con in progress The Department for Communities and Local Government has allowed until December 2010 for prepare local authorities for the publication of spending, contracts and tenders above £500. Around a third have already done so, though not always in open formats\nGOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY We will ensure that all data published by public bodies is published in an open and standardised format, so that it can be used easily and with minimal cost by third parties. Con wait and see The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan terms this an 'ongoing' action from June 2010\nIMMIGRATION We will introduce an annual limit on the number of non-EU economic migrants admitted into the UK to live and work. We will consider jointly the mechanism for implementing the limit. Con in progress The home secretary, Theresa May, has announced a temporary cap of 24,000 workers from outside the EU before April 2011 while the coalition (not all of whom support it) consults on a permanent limit. The current cap excludes transfers within multinationals, which is equal to 45% of current working visa applications\nIMMIGRATION We will end the detention of children for immigration purposes. LD in progress 9/9/10 Immigration Minister Damien Green announced the abandonment of its promise to end child detention, instead claiming an intention to 'minimise' detention of children. However, Green claims that the intention remains to end the practice. A Home Office review runs until August with a March 2011 deadline for implementation – however, one pilot scheme to deport families and children within two weeks or instructing them to leave voluntarily in an ultimatum, has dashed expectations of a more liberal alternative. Refugee welfare groups had wanted measures such as bail, electronic tagging and reporting requirements (also in LD manifesto)\nIMMIGRATION We will create a dedicated Border Police Force, as part of a refocused Serious Organised Crime Agency, to enhance national security, improve immigration controls and crack down on the trafficking of people, weapons and drugs. We will work with police forces to strengthen arrangements to deal with serious crime and other cross-boundary policing challenges, and extend collaboration between forces to deliver better value for money. Both in progress The Home Office structural reform plan anticipates a dedicated border police force by April 2013, with work beginning on it in October 2010. (The Liberal Democrats had proposed a national border force with police powers, for what it's worth)\nIMMIGRATION We support E-borders and will reintroduce exit checks. Neither / LD wait and see This represents a continuation of existing policy. No evidence yet of what more the coalition will be doing to show its support for e-borders, though the Home Office draft structural reform plan sets the pledge a December 2014 deadline. The Home Office draft structural reform plan gives the pledge for exit checks a December 2014 deadline. No details yet on how this will work\nIMMIGRATION We will apply transitional controls as a matter of course in the future for all new EU Member States. Con in progress Hard to track but Awaiting new EU members (Turkey?)\nIMMIGRATION We will introduce new measures to minimise abuse of the immigration system, for example via student routes, and will tackle human trafficking as a priority. Con wait and see The Home Office draft structural reform plan sets out an autumn 2010 to January 2011 timeframe to review the student visa system and bring forward proposals. So far, the coalition has opted out of an EU directive designed to co-ordinate European efforts to combat the trade in sex slaves. A Home Office spokesman said the UK already complied with most of what is required by the draft EU directive and the government 'will review the UK's position once the directive has been agreed'\nIMMIGRATION We will explore new ways to improve the current asylum system to speed up the processing of applications. LD in progress The Home Office draft structural reform sets out a June to December 2010 period to review and develop proposals and a December 2011 deadline for implementation\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will honour our commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid from 2013, and to enshrine this commitment in law.

It will be enshrined in law by October 2011, according to the Department for International Development draft structural reform plan\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will encourage other countries to fulfil their aid commitments. ? in progress Nick Clegg says he will fight hard 'to secure commitments from other nations and the private sector that will deliver real progress towards meeting these vital goals' at the September 2010 Millennium Development Goals summit in New York\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will support actions to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. In particular, we will prioritise aid spending on programmes to ensure that everyone has access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare and education; to reduce maternal and infant mortality; and to restrict the spread of major diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. We will recognise the vital role of women in development, promote gender equality and focus on the rights of women, children and disabled people to access services. Both in progress The Department for International Development draft structural reform plan says objectives will be specified from June 2010 to March 2011.\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will use the aid budget to support the development of local democratic institutions, civil society groups, the media and enterprise; and support efforts to tackle corruption. ? in progress The Department for International Development draft structural reform plan says it will develop and publish guidelines so 5% of all budget support goes on accountability issues from July to December 2010\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will introduce full transparency in aid and publish details of all UK aid spending online. We will push for similarly high levels of transparency internationally. Con in progress The coalition has introduced an aid transparency guarantee. The DFID draft structural reform plan says information on projects over £500 will be published from January 2011, when the department will also push for an international aid transparency standard\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will create new mechanisms to give British people a direct say in how an element of the aid budget is spent. Con wait and see David Cameron announced a 'MyAid' plan for voting on development priorities when in opposition, which appears to be the origin of this pledge. The Department for International Development draft structural reform plan says the 'new mechanism' will be launched in June 2011\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will keep aid untied from commercial interests, and will maintain DfID as an independent department focused on poverty reduction. Con Done Very much sticking to the status quo, though development secretary Andrew Mitchell has announced a review of the 90 countries that receive aid (to report in the autumn) to see that it is focussed on poverty reduction. Aid to China and Russia is to be phased out so it can be redeployed to poorer nations\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will stick to the rules laid down by the OECD about what spending counts as aid. Con Done\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will push hard in 2010 to make greater progress in tackling maternal and infant mortality. Both in progress Reducing maternal and infant mortality is one of the Millennium Development goals. The Department for International Development draft structural reform plan says MDG objectives will be published in March 2011\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will work to accelerate the process of relieving Heavily Indebted Poor Countries of their debt. ? ?\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will support efforts to establish an International Arms Trade Treaty to limit the sales of arms to dangerous regimes. LD in progress Support for the arms trade treaty is a continuation of the work of the previous government. Agreement on a treaty is expected in 2012\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will support pro-development trade deals, including the proposed Pan-African Free Trade Area. Con in progress The Department for International Development checked off pushing for a successful outcome to the Doha trade talks from its to do list following the Toronto G20 summit (although Doha goes on, David Cameron has called for a new approach in order to conclude it). A trade white paper is also scheduled for December 2010\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will support innovative and effective smaller British non-governmental organisations that are committed to tackling poverty. Con in progress The Department for International Development draft structural reform plan says a Poverty Impact Fund is being designed from July 2010 and will be launched in May 2011\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will explore ways of helping the very poorest developing countries to take part in international climate change negotiations. Con wait and see Downing Street briefing papers released with the Queen's speech said the government will explore ways of helping the very poorest developing countries take part in climate change negotiations\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will ensure that UK Trade and Investment and the Export Credits Guarantee Department become champions for British companies that develop and export innovative green technologies around the world, instead of supporting investment in dirty fossil-fuel energy production. Con ?\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will provide a more integrated approach to post-conflict reconstruction where the British military is involved – building on the Stabilisation Unit in Whitehall and creating a new Stabilisation and Reconstruction Force to bridge the gap between the military and the reconstruction effort. Con ? They have cut internships/work placements...\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will review what action can be taken against ‘vulture funds’. LD wait and see A 'sunset clause' in the Debt Relief Act 2010 requires the government to assess its impact on debt markets then choose to renew or not by June 2011. Or the coalition could choose to do something else\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT We will support reform of global financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in order to increase the involvement of developing nations. LD ?\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will end all existing welfare to work programmes and create a single welfare to work programme to help all unemployed people get back into work. Con in progress The employment minister, Chris Grayling, opened bidding for contracts to run the £3bn-a-year programme. When it is in place in June 2011, providers will be paid almost exclusively by results and out of savings made from getting people off benefits. There are also plans in a Department for Work and Pensions white paper\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will ensure that Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants facing the most significant barriers to work are referred to the new welfare to work programme immediately, not after 12 months as is currently the case. We will ensure that Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants aged under 25 are referred to the programme after a maximum of six months. Con in progress\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will realign contracts with welfare to work service providers to reflect more closely the results they achieve in getting people back into work. ? in progress The £3bn-a-year welfare-to-work programme will pay providers almost exclusively by results when it is in place in June 2011\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will reform the funding mechanism used by government to finance welfare to work programmes to reflect the fact that initial investment delivers later savings through lower benefit expenditure, including creating an integrated work programme with outcome funding based upon the DEL/AME switch. ? in progress The £3bn-a-year welfare-to-work programme will pay providers out of savings made from getting people off benefits when it is in place in June 2011\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will ensure that receipt of benefits for those able to work is conditional on their willingness to work. Con in progress All 2.5million incapacity benefit claimants will be removed from the scheme by 2014. After reassessment beginning in April 2011, those deemed able to work will be moved to jobseekers allowance, where they will be under stricter requirements to find work or be given greater support to do so\nJOBS AND WELFARE We support the National Minimum Wage because of the protection it gives low-income workers and the incentives to work it provides. Both Done The over-21s national minimum wage will rise from £5.80 to £5.93 from October 2010. However, the coalition has taken the Tory position on it - Liberal Democrat proposals to make it the same rate for all over 16 were not carried through\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will re-assess all current claimants of Incapacity Benefit for their readiness to work. Those assessed as fully capable for work will be moved onto Jobseeker’s Allowance. Con in progress\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will support would-be entrepreneurs through a new programme – Work for Yourself – which will give the unemployed access to business mentors and start-up loans. Con ?\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will draw on a range of Service Academies to offer pre-employment training and work placements for unemployed people. Con in progress The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills draft structural reform plan sets a spring 2011 deadline to 'explore' this and other training measures\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will develop local Work Clubs – places where unemployed people can gather to exchange skills, find opportunities, make contacts and provide mutual support. Con\nJOBS AND WELFARE We will investigate how to simplify the benefit system in order to improve incentives to work. ? in progress A welfare reform bill was announced in the Queen's speech to simplify benefits and get one million back to work. The government's thinking is that the complexity of the benefits system leaves people afraid to make any change to their circumstances\nJUSTICE We will introduce a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ that will pay independent providers to reduce reoffending, paid for by the savings this new approach will generate within the criminal justice system. Con in progress In Kenneth Clarke's first major speech as justice secretary he said the government will pay private firms and voluntary groups according to how many prisoners they rehabilitate. Reviews are underway, a rehabilitation green paper scheduled for November and a pilot scheme in operation at Peterborough prison\nJUSTICE We will conduct a full review of sentencing policy to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting reoffending. In particular, we will ensure that sentencing for drug use helps offenders come off drugs. Both in progress A rehabilitation green paper is to be published in November. The justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, will seek to divert thousands of offenders away from short-term sentences. In their manifestos, the Conservatives wanted for courts to specify minimum and maximum sentences while the Liberal Democrats wanted less short-term sentences\nJUSTICE We will explore alternative forms of secure, treatment-based accommodation for mentally ill and drugs offenders.

They also said the Treasury would work with the Cabinet Office on the strategy and review.\nNATIONAL SECURITY We will urgently review Control Orders, as part of a wider review of counter-terrorist legislation, measures and programmes. We will seek to find a practical way to allow the use of intercept evidence in court. LD in progress The imposition of control orders (house arrest and electronic tagging) on terror suspects who cannot be brought to court is included in Lord Ken Macdonald's review of counter terror legislation, which reports in the autumn. No firm plans yet on intercept evidence. A Home Office spokesperson said the use of intercept evidence was 'a complex area and the government will now consider how to build on the work of the privy council committee to bring about a workable solution'.\nNATIONAL SECURITY We will deny public funds to any group that has recently espoused or incited violence or hatred.

The remainder of the PCT’s board will be appointed by the relevant local authority or authorities, and the Chief Executive and principal officers will be appointed by the Secretary of State on the advice of the new independent NHS board. This will ensure the right balance between locally accountable individuals and technical expertise. LD Failed Can be considered a re-wording of the Liberal Democrats' local health boards proposal - however, primary care trusts are to be scrapped and replaced with consortia of Gps.\nNHS The local PCT will act as a champion for patients and commission those residual services that are best undertaken at a wider level, rather than directly by GPs. It will also take responsibility for improving public health for people in their area, working closely with the local authority and other local organisations. ? Failed Health Secretary Andrew Lansley's white paper on NHS reform abolishes all 152 primary care trusts by 2013. Their public health role will go to local authorities\nNHS If a local authority has concerns about a significant proposed closure of local services, for example an A&E department, it will have the right to challenge health organisations, and refer the case to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel.

The 'triple guarantee' of the coalition agreement represents a win for the Liberal Democrats, who made that specific proposal (the Conservatives stopped at earnings)\nPENSIONS AND OLDER PEOPLE We will commit to establishing an independent commission to review the long-term affordability of public sector pensions, while protecting accrued rights. LD in progress Former Blairite minister John Hutton is to lead a commission producing an interim report in September and a final review for the 2011 budget.

We will end the rules requiring compulsory annuitisation at 75. ? in progress The government has announced a review of when the state pension age should rise. It is being carried out alongside a consultation on scrapping the default retirement age - currently 65 - from October 2011. End of compulsory annuitisation at 75.

A classic example of a Liberal Democrat manifesto pledge with 'explore the potential' appended to the front of it\nPENSIONS AND OLDER PEOPLE We will protect key benefits for older people such as the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences, free bus travel, and free eye tests and prescriptions. Both wait and see While both parties agree here, it is a policy with more of a Conservative flavour because the Liberal Democrats wanted to extend winter fuel payments to disabled people. However, with suggestions they could be cut, it has become a red line issue for backbench Liberal Democrats\nPENSIONS AND OLDER PEOPLE We will simplify the rules and regulations relating to pensions to help reinvigorate occupational pensions, encouraging companies to offer high-quality pensions to all employees, and we will work with business and the industry to support auto enrolment. Con in progress The government has announced it will link private occupational pensions to CPI, in a move designed to take £100 billion off the estimated £239bn black hole in final salary schemes. But a switch from RPI - which is higher - will see recipients of those schemes worse off\nPOLITICAL REFORM We will establish five-year fixed-term Parliaments. We will put a binding motion before the House of Commons stating that the next general election will be held on the first Thursday of May 2015.

BUT Requiring a 55% majority to dissolve a fixed term parliament met with stiff opposition from critics who said a lame-duck government could lose a confidence vote yet still stay in power. It was torn up and Nick Clegg announced a simple majority in a confidence vote will now trigger a general election if no government is formed after 14 days\nPOLITICAL REFORM We will bring forward a Referendum Bill on electoral reform, which includes provision for the introduction of the Alternative Vote in the event of a positive result in the referendum, as well as for the creation of fewer and more equal sized constituencies.

LD in progress Nick Clegg is set to introduce a bill into the Commons for a 5 May 2011 referendum. The bill has had its second reading, but opposition from Labour, Tory backbenchers and nationalists means it will struggle to pass unamended.

In the interim, Lords appointments will be made with the objective of creating a second chamber that is reflective of the share of the vote secured by the political parties in the last general election.

The Liberal Democrat pledge of a fully elected chamber could be reduced to 'mainly' but the party has gained PR as the voting mechanism\nPOLITICAL REFORM We will bring forward the proposals of the Wright Committee for reform to the House of Commons in full – starting with the proposed committee for management of backbench business. A House Business Committee, to consider government business, will be established by the third year of the Parliament.

Depending on the outcome of the forthcoming referendum, we will establish a process similar to the Calman Commission for the Welsh Assembly.

LD Done Schools administered under the Academies Act will be bound to the admissions code. The shadow education secretary, Ed Balls, has, however, said he fears the changes will lead to 'social apartheid' in education. Non-selection was a Liberal Democrat priority, though the party had not supported the academies systemThe Academies Act allows for new school providers, it also states that faith groups wanting to take advantage of the scheme must pledge that only 50% of admissions will be on the grounds of faith\nSOCIAL ACTION We will support the creation and expansion of mutuals, co-operatives, charities and social enterprises, and enable these groups to have much greater involvement in the running of public services. Both in progress Downing Street briefing papers said the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, would oversee where social enterprises, charities and cooperatives could have a role in the delivery of public services. The Cabinet Office also wants to reduce the bureaucratic burden on small civil society organisations\nSOCIAL ACTION We will give public sector workers a new right to form employee-owned co-operatives and bid to take over the services they deliver. This will empower millions of public sector workers to become their own boss and help them to deliver better services. ? in progress Downing Street briefing papers released with the Queen's speech said that, where appropriate, social enterprises, charities and co-operatives will be allowed to bid to run public services. Early measures will be in place in the autumn, Downing Street said\nSOCIAL ACTION We will train a new generation of community organisers and support the creation of neighbourhood groups across the UK, especially in the most deprived areas. Con in progress The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan sets a June 2010 to January 2011 timeframe for this pledge\nSOCIAL ACTION We will take a range of measures to encourage charitable giving and philanthropy. Con in progress The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan says it is working with the Treasury on options to incentivise social investment and philanthropy, with a January 2011 delivery date\nSOCIAL ACTION We will introduce National Citizen Service. The initial flagship project will provide a programme for 16 year olds to give them a chance to develop the skills needed to be active and responsible citizens, mix with people from different backgrounds, and start getting involved in their communities. Con wait and see The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan says it is undertaking 'preparatory work for pilots' and developing a roll-out plan\nSOCIAL ACTION We will use funds from dormant bank accounts to establish a ‘Big Society Bank’, which will provide new finance for neighbourhood groups, charities, social enterprises and other non-governmental bodies. Con in progress The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plans says it is working with the Treasury on a big society bank and anticipates the first funds will become available in April 2011\nSOCIAL ACTION We will take a range of measures to encourage volunteering and involvement in social action, including launching a national day to celebrate and encourage social action, and make regular community service an element of civil service staff appraisals. Con wait and see Big Society Day to be announced in Sept. The Cabinet Office draft structural reform plan says it is 'exploring' how to make regular volunteering a part of civil service staff appraisals from June to December 2010\nSOCIAL CARE AND DISABILITY We will establish a commission on long-term care, to report within a year. The commission will consider a range of ideas, including both a voluntary insurance scheme to protect the assets of those who go into residential care, and a partnership scheme as proposed by Derek Wanless. ? in progress The Department of Health draft structural reform plan says the commission will report in July 2011 and a white paper on social care will be published in October 2011\nSOCIAL CARE AND DISABILITY We will break down barriers between health and social care funding to incentivise preventative action. Con in progress Downing Street briefing papers released with the Queen's speech said reform will mean 'health and social care working together to keep people at home'. The Department of Health draft structural reform plan schedules a post-discharge tariff requiring NHS and social care to work together from April 2011\nSOCIAL CARE AND DISABILITY We will extend the greater roll-out of personal budgets to give people and their carers more control and purchasing power. Con in progress Downing Street briefing papers released with the Queen's speech said reform will mean personalised budgets offered by all councils. A pilot scheme involving eight primary care trusts was announced in June - publication of the evaluation and national roll-out are scheduled for October 2012\nSOCIAL CARE AND DISABILITY We will use direct payments to carers and better community-based provision to improve access to respite care. Con in progress Downing Street briefing papers released with the Queen's speech said reform will mean direct payments to carers and other support for their own needs\nSOCIAL CARE AND DISABILITY We will reform Access to Work, so disabled people can apply for jobs with funding already secured for any adaptations and equipment they will need.

We will announce in the first Budget a substantial increase in the personal allowance from April 2011, with the benefits focused on those with lower and middle incomes. This will be funded with the money that would have been used to pay for the increase in employee National Insurance thresholds proposed by the Conservative Party, as well as revenues from increases in Capital Gains Tax rates for non-business assets as described below. The increase in employer National Insurance thresholds proposed by the Conservatives will go ahead in order to stop the planned jobs tax. LD Done The personal allowance will rise £1000 to £7,475 in April 2011, benefiting 23 million basic rate taxpayers up to £170 a year. Reverses Labour's proposed national insurance rises on employers. A red line Conservative measure. The national insurance bill raises contributions for employers and employees by 1p but offsets the effects for employers with a rise in the threshold from April 2011 and lifts 650,000 employees out of the tax altogether.\nTAXATION We will further increase the personal allowance to £10,000, making real terms steps each year towards meeting this as a longer-term policy objective. We will prioritise this over other tax cuts, including cuts to Inheritance Tax. LD in progress George Osborne announced in the budget a £1,000 raise in the personal allowance to £7,475, as a part of a long-term £10,000 objective. The pledge (albeit without the longer-term objective) was a key Liberal Democrats policies. Its long timescale means it is likely to remain 'In progress' for the life of the coalition. Prioritising income tax allowances over inheritance tax was a victory for the Liberal Democrats over what had been a totemic Conservative policy. The National insurance contributions bill in the Queen's speech reallocates around £9bn into raising income tax allowances.\nTAXATION We will also ensure that provision is made for Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain on budget resolutions to introduce transferable tax allowances for married couples without prejudice to the coalition agreement.

LD wait and see George Osborne announced in the budget that the government would explore changes to aviation tax - but no further details as yet\nTAXATION We will seek ways of taxing non-business capital gains at rates similar or close to those applied to income, with generous exemptions for entrepreneurial business activities. LD Failed The language changed early on. The Queen's speech dropped 'similar or close to', instead saying CGT would be 'closer' to income tax. When George Osborne announced the new higher rate in his first budget it was 28% - up 18% but still some way below 40% or 50% higher rate income tax\nTAXATION We will make every effort to tackle tax avoidance, including detailed development of Liberal Democrat proposals. LD wait and see A national insurance contributions bill in the Queen's speech may include this pledge, Downing Street said.

Con wait and see A decision on the financing and number of charging points will be delayed until the comprehensive spending review in the autumn\nTRANSPORT We will grant longer rail franchises in order to give operators the incentive to invest in the improvements passengers want – like better services, better stations, longer trains and better rolling stock. Con wait and see The government has announced a review of rail franchising policy to report by end of 2010. It was welcomed by the Association of Train Operating Companies, who want to see longer franchises\nTRANSPORT We will reform the way decisions are made on which transport projects to prioritise, so that the benefits of low carbon proposals (including light rail schemes) are fully recognised. ? in progress The coalition has announced funding for several schemes, including £15m for green buses, £40,000 for car clubs and up to £5,000 towards purchase of an ultra-low carbon car from January 2011.

        "conteudo": "How many deaths does climate change have to cause before someone takes responsibility? Our current use of fossil fuels has “potentially catastrophic effects for human health and human survival”, according to a major new report released on Tuesday by medical journal the Lancet and University College London. And it’s not as if we still have time before climate change starts to bite.\nRelated: Climate change threatens 50 years of progress in global health, study says\nAs long ago as 2009, Kofi Annan’s Global Humanitarian Forum estimated that there were already 300,000 deaths a year from additional heatwaves, floods, droughts and forest fires attributable to global warming – a total which would rise to 500,000 a year by 2030. The Madrid-based climate change watch group Dara and the Climate Vulnerable Forum put deaths at about 400,000 a year, increasing to 600,000 by 2030. And last year the World Health Organisation estimated that the number of deaths from just the additional burden of disease and heatwaves would be 250,000 a year between 2030 and 2050.\nIf such figures are right, and the annual human cost of climate change is already around 100 times greater than that of the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, the inaction of our governments looks bizarre. Estimates suggest that current national pledges to reduce carbon emissions by 2020, submitted in preparation for the UN’s climate change conference in Paris in December, will delay the arrival of more dangerous climate change by only two years – from 2036 to 2038. The number of deaths from climate change will continue to rise, but just a little bit more slowly.\nDuring the 200 years since the beginning of industrialisation, the concentration of carbon in the air has increased from 280 to 400 parts per million, a rise of more than 40%. Human beings have never breathed such high levels of carbon, and the world is now more likely to be heading for a 3-4C rise in temperature rather than the 2C maximum thought safe. Yet international agreements to cut carbon emissions are still stymied – partly by the tactics of fossil fuel companies and partly by the lack of trust between developed and developing nations. In her book This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein has documented how oil and coal companies have successfully deployed every kind of delaying tactic, including penetrating environmental campaigning groups, buying politicians and misrepresenting climate science. From the health effects of smoking, to food standards and the safety of pharmaceuticals, such tactics have become familiar whenever the pursuit of profit conflicts with the public interest.\nNaomi Klein on tackling climate change and inequality - video\nEven now, the major oil companies cannot agree on whether to support a carbon pricing system: BP and Shell are for it, but Exxon Mobil and Chevron are against.\nIn this situation, you might expect governments to sue the fossil fuel companies and claim damages on behalf of their citizens, but it seems that the boot is firmly on the other foot. Large corporations are increasingly suing democratically elected governments that pass laws or impose regulations that may be detrimental to commercial interests. With international investment agreements in place, multinationals have won hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation from governments imposing regulations designed simply to protect the environment. And this situation is going to get a whole lot worse if the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) goes ahead. It will allow the corporate coach and horses to ride roughshod over democratic governments.\nIs it possible to imagine a mass movement ever turning this round and reasserting the primacy of democratic control and the public interest over the pursuit of profit? Perhaps. This newspaper’s campaign to get institutions to divest from fossil fuel companies is gaining adherents, and is an important start.\nRelated: The TTIP trade deal will throw equality before the law on the corporate bonfire | George Monbiot\nAnother promising strategy has been proposed by Professor Robert Costanza and Dr Ida Kubiszewski, both ecological economists at the Australian National University in Canberra. They argue that one way of gaining leverage in this situation would be to create an Earth Atmospheric Trust. Given that the atmosphere is a community asset which serves all of us, we need to use the public trust doctrine (outlined by Mary Wood in her book Nature’s Trust: Environmental Law for a New Ecological Age) to assert ownership through a public trust. The public trust doctrine exists in many countries with legal systems derived from Roman law and has been used to protect common natural resources such as water sources, shorelines and wildlife for public benefit. Because the atmosphere is a global asset, we would need governments to act as co-trustees with a duty to protect the air and take action against those who pollute it.\nLegal action for damages would have to start with the 90 fossil fuel companies that are estimated to be responsible for two-thirds of all carbon emissions. Just as BP was required to pay damages after the Deepwater oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, so these companies would have to pay for the spillage of carbon into the atmosphere which their products cause. Based on average estimates, damages might be set at $125 per ton of carbon. Proceeds should be used to fund the transition to renewable energy sources.\nIt will take carefully planned popular pressure to weaken corporate opposition and push governments into acting on our behalf. To get this moving, Costanza and Kubiszewski propose a campaign to “Claim the Sky” as a public trust on behalf of global society. You can support it by signing up on Avaaz. Together we can campaign to invoice fossil fuel companies for the damage their intransigence causes.",

        "conteudo": "The Rosetta mission’s hibernating lander could awake within weeks, according to new predictions that it will soon be receiving enough sunlight to recharge its batteries.\nThe Philae probe shut down just three days after making a spectacular, but bumpy, landing on the duck-shaped comet, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and has been in a dormant state ever since. Despite making it to within half a mile of its target on the comet’s “head”, after a 250 million mile journey through space, the lander came to rest in the shadow of a cliff meaning that its solar-powered batteries have been unable to recharge since November.\nAs the comet approaches the sun, the lander will be experiencing more intense sunlight, and the latest analysis suggest it could enter its re-booting routine within weeks.\nStephan Ulamec, the lander manager, said: “What we’ve learnt is that the power will probably be sufficient ... The lander may be able to boot in April or May.”\nFor it to switch back on, two key conditions need to be met, Ulamec added. First, the interior of the lander needs to be at least -45C before it can be switched back on safely.\n“The lander is designed in a way that if the temperature is below -45C, power on board would be used for heating rather than booting the computer,” said Ulamec.\nSecond, Philae needs to be able to harvest enough energy from its solar panels to reboot and re-establish communication with its mothership Rosetta, which is tracking the comet from around 200km away. It is already receiving more than twice the amount of solar energy than in November, the scientists calculate, based on their best estimates of the position of the lander.\n“The situation is improving every day as we’re approaching the sun, but we are very cold - this is the problem,” Ulamec told the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, in Vienna today.\nAssuming the interior of the lander warms up enough, the Rosetta team predict that communications could be re-established by May or June and that by July and September Philae is likely to be getting enough energy to recharge its batteries, allowing it to continue operations at “night-time”, when it is not in direct sunlight.\nUltimately, it may be possible to re-operate the lander’s drill and collect more surface samples, which would be baked in a small on-board oven to analyse the gases given off. In November, a drilling attempt was not completely successful, and scientists are not sure if the sample was collected properly. “I would dream of having another sample from the surface,” said Ulamec. “At the start we’ll have to be more modest though.”\nScientists now know that when deployed in November, Philae rebounded twice from the comet’s surface before coming to a final standstill. Although this ultimately left the craft asleep in the shade, it did mean that data was obtained from several points on the surface.\nA new analysis of these results, together with measurements made by Rosetta, have shown that, contrary to prior expectations, the comet does not have its own magnetic field.\n“The unplanned flight across the surface actually meant we could collect precise magnetic field measurements with Philae at the four points we made contact with, and at a range of heights above the surface,” said Hans-Ulrich Auster, a Rosetta scientists and lead author of the findings published today in the journal Science.\nThe discovery challenges one of the leading theories on how comets and the precursors of planets first began to form in the infant solar system.\nInitially, the sun was surrounded by just a swirling disc of gas and dust and it was thought that magnetic fields, created by charged particles flowing from the sun, may have played an important role in drawing together clumps of material in space, like iron filings being pulled in by a magnet.\nThe latest measurements found no evidence that magnetic material such as iron is organised within the comet 67P, which it would have been if magnetism had first drawn it together.\nAndrew Coates, head of planetary science at UCL’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: “The problem with solar system formation has always been what gets it going in the first place.”\nAccording to Ulamec: “One leading theory has to be deleted from the textbook now.”\nThe findings suggest that swarms of particles may have simply stuck together when they happened to bump into each other, eventually snowballing into masses big enough to have sufficient gravity to accumulate further material.",

        "conteudo": "Loft insulation will save you up to £180 a year, says the government – and a new boiler will cut as much as £310 off your bills. But the first official study on the true impact of energy efficiency measures installed in British households indicates that the financial savings have been around half the amount promised.\nIn a devastating blow for the government's controversial Green Deal programme, an analysis of the figures by a leading environmentalist suggests that the annual savings from loft insulation on 21,000 homes tracked by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) have been around £15.50 a year, compared with the \"up to £180\" figure promoted by government bodies.\nThe Energy Saving Trust, part funded by the government, has told consumers that a new boiler will save between £105 and £310 a year. Its figures are the gold standard in the energy industry, and have been widely used in adverts by companies such as British Gas to persuade householders to spend thousands of pounds replacing an old boiler. But the DECC figures suggest that the typical annual saving on bills has, in reality, been closer to just £70 a year.\nThe boiler scrappage scheme gave people money off replacement fittings. Photograph: Isopress/Rex Features\nIn 2009 the Labour government launched its £200m boiler scrappage scheme which gave £400 off a new boiler. Around 125,000 homes replaced their often working boiler with a new one, encouraged by what now look like discredited figures.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says it is reviewing its financial guidance and will, later this month, downgrade the savings it tells consumers they can expect to earn from installing energy efficiency measures. It could come as the final blow for the Green Deal programme, which relies on estimates of future financial savings to encourage consumers to take out loans to pay for energy-saving home improvements.\nThe figures are contained in the National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework (NEED) published by the DECC late last year. It examined \"observed\" savings from loft insulation in 21,000 homes, new boilers in nearly 14,000 homes, and cavity wall insulation installed in 16,000 homes, and compared them with properties that did not have the measures installed. It found that on average, loft insulation decreases home gas consumption by 1.7%, cavity wall insulation by 7.8% and a new boiler by 9.2% (median figures were slightly higher). Installing all three produced greater savings.\nIt concluded that: \"There are significant savings from installations of all the energy efficiency measures considered in this report, and provides further support for the value of installing each individually or in combination.\"\nBut environmentalist Chris Goodall, author of How to Live a Low Carbon Life and who stood as a Green Party candidate in the 2010 general election, says that while the measures undeniably cut energy consumption, they come nowhere near the financial savings claimed by the energy industry. \"Home insulation measures deliver half the savings that are claimed,\" he says, adding that households that take out the government's Green Deal, far from saving money, will actually be worse off by around £200 a year. His analysis is published on his blog, carboncommentary.com.\nGoodall took the NEED figure for the average number of kilowatt hours of gas that the 21,000 households in the study saved through loft insulation – 400kWh – and multiplied it by the 3.874p per kWh, which is the cheapest tariff offered by any of the big six energy companies at the time, in mid-December.\nThe saving works out at just £15.50. Even with all the measures added together, he calculates that the households have made a saving worth just £139.46 off their gas bills – half the Energy Saving Trust's headline estimate of £270.\nPoorly installed insulation is a 'depressingly common phenomenon'. Photograph: Alamy\nIn one of Goodall's most extraordinary findings, he notes how in some properties gas bills actually went up after the installation of energy efficiency measures. \"Perhaps 40% of homes with new insulation experienced increased bills compared to the control group. This might be because the insulation was installed badly – a depressingly common phenomenon – or because the occupants decided to heat their house to a higher temperature as a result of the better insulation.\"\nWe showed Goodall's findings to both the Energy Saving Trust and the DECC. David Weatherall, energy efficiency expert at the trust, said: \"The NEED data is the first large-scale data on energy saving and we are looking at what the numbers mean, and releasing updated figures. There will be a reduction in the average savings figures we use, based on the NEED data.\" But he added that the data \"is not really comparing apples with apples\" and that \"we are definitely not in the business of overstating the savings that can be achieved\".\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that its figure for a £180 saving from loft insulation only refers to \"virgin\" homes that have never had insulation before, while the figure for a £310 saving on a boiler is for a G-rated boiler (the most energy inefficient) being replaced by an A-rated boiler. Many of the households in the NEED data will have been upgrading for D or even C-rated boilers, and may have only been adding some additional insulation, rather than fitting it for the first time.\nDECC disputed the accuracy of Goodall's figures. \"The Carbon Commentary comparison of costs and savings is inaccurate, whereas DECC has developed a methodology – approved by independent experts on the Committee on Climate Change – to calculate savings from energy efficiency measures. No one can borrow more than they will pay back in energy savings, so no one will lose money by taking out a Green Deal loan.\"\nThe Energy Saving Trust declined to say the scale of the reductions it will make for its energy saving estimates, but said new figures will be issued at the end of the month. They are likely to have a significant impact on the insulation industry, which uses the trust's figures extensively in advertising. British Gas, for example, advertises loft insulation with the claim that it will \"Help reduce your energy bills by up to £180 a year,\" sourcing that to the Energy Saving Trust.\nDeputy PM Nick Clegg said the Green Deal would help people reduce their energy bills. Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PA\nThe implications for the Green Deal, introduced by the government in January 2013, are serious. At the time deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said: \"The Green Deal will help thousands of homes stay warm for less. Those people will benefit from energy saving improvements – and their energy bills will fall.\"\nBut the Green Deal relies on a mathematical calculation that sets the cost of installing items such as new boiler against the projected savings, and lets households obtain a loan if the savings outweigh the costs. The programme has so far failed to take off (see right) and once the Energy Saving Trust reduces its estimates for future savings, even fewer households will qualify for a loan.\nExisting households who have taken the Green Deal may also feel misled. Goodall says: \"When is DECC going to get sued for not telling people trying their best to save money that the Green Deal will typically cost families hundreds of pounds a year?\"",

        "conteudo": "RWE, one of Britain's biggest renewable energy investors, is planning to significantly scale back its spending in the UK and expects to sell off wind farms and a major biomass plant.\nEmployees, local communities and regional councils are to be offered stakes in RWE projects as the company retreats in the face of its own huge debts, a plunging share price, and uncertain government policies.\nRWE, whose npower retail arm is one of the UK's big six power suppliers, has already shelved what would have been one of the world's largest offshore wind farms, the Atlantic Array, among other businesses.\nPaul Coffey, the chief operating officer of RWE npower Renewables, said his company was still committed to a pipeline of green power projects in Britain but admitted the era of his German-owned company taking majority stakes in future big offshore wind farms was probably over.\nRWE is already considering whether to reduce its involvement in the proposed Galloper offshore wind farm off the Suffolk coast from 50% to 25% and said this sort of move was likely to become more common.\n\"I would never say never ... (but) there are more drivers to taking smaller stakes rather than larger ones,\" he said, adding that the company was now focusing on \"value not volume\".\nThe RWE executive, whose firm already owns major offshore wind farms such as Greater Gabbard and Gwynt y Mor, was unwilling to spell out the exact scale of the spending cuts, saying they would be made public on 4 March when the global renewable energy business - RWE Innogy - gives its annual briefing.\nLast year, RWE announced it would be halving the group's overall clean-tech spending planned for 2014 from €1bn (£830m) to €500m and the new figure for this year will be lower still. In 2013, £500m of the total spend went to the UK but the figure is expected to fall to around £300m now, some believe.\nThe parent group is suffering under debts of €30bn on the back of plunging European electricity prices and the German government's decision to force the early closure of local nuclear power stations.\nRWE admitted that continuing uncertainty and problems with the UK government's much-delayed Electricity Market Reform programme was also influencing the spending cutbacks.\nJulia Lynch Williams, the UK managing director of RWE npower Renewables, who sits on a host of government working groups, said the electricity market reform programme \"has got to be concluded soon\" but also stressed that \"we need some improvements\" to its provisions.\nMeanwhile, the company expects to sell half of its 700MW of onshore wind development pipeline in the next few years and is considering an option to sell its £200m Markinch biomass plant in Fife, Scotland, which is just about to come online. It is claimed to be the largest biomass combined heat and power plant in the UK.\nRWE has already shut down a coal-fired plant that it developed into biomass at Tilbury on the Thames due to a lack of expected government financial support.\nThe utility has also disposed of a £218m stake in a power supply business, its £350m stake in the Horizon nuclear power venture, and is searching for a buyer for its DEA oil exploration arm, operator of 13 productive gasfields in the North Sea.\nThe company says it wants to move further to a \"capital light\" position where it is bringing in a range of outside investors and partners to help with its many schemes.\nRWE has already undertaken trials in Germany of selling stakes in the Jüchen onshore wind project, located in North Rhine-Westphalia, to its own staff and even local authorities.\nRWE says these intiatives can be quite complicated but may be followed in the UK. It is already exploring partnerships with community ownership in relation to new onshore wind farms in Wales and Scotland on Forestry Commission sites. \"It's certainly of interest to us,\" said RWE npower Renewables' Lynch Williams.\n\"We want to be a trusted partner,\" said Coffey, whose business is dropping the \"npower\" part of the name - something he insists is unassociated with that particular business's image problems.\nIn December, npower agreed to pay £3.5m to help vulnerable customers as a punishment imposed by the regulator for misleading consumers considering switching their energy provider.",

        "conteudo": "Australia should aim to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2025, compared with 2000 levels, in order to catch up to other countries’ efforts and prove it is a “good global citizen”, according to a Climate Change Authority review.\nThe CCA, an independent statutory agency that advises the government, also recommended that Australia ramp up its emissions cuts even further by 2030, within a target range of 40% and 60%, again based on 2000 levels.\nThe report restates the authority’s position that Australia should raise its immediate emissions reduction target from 5% by 2020 to 19% by the same year, warning that in the absence of stronger action “the task of achieving credible 2020 and subsequent targets will become progressively more challenging.”\nThe Australian government has issued a discussion paper on what the country’s post-2020 emissions target should be, ahead of crunch UN climate talks in Paris in December.\nThe US has already committed to a 26-28% cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2025, while the European Union has a goal of a 40% cut on 1990 levels by 2030. China has agreed to peak its carbon output by around 2030, while the UK, Russia and Germany have all also submitted new targets.\nAustralia, by comparison, has missed a UN deadline to reveal its post-2020 emissions target and has faced questions from China, the US and Brazil over the effectiveness of its Direct Action policy, which replaced the carbon pricing system, scrapped by the Coalition last year.\nThe CCA report notes that while Australia contributes only 1.3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, its fossil fuel-heavy economy is the largest per capita emitter in the industrialised world and that its efforts “should be comparable with those of other wealthy developed countries and free of any special pleading.”\nThe report adds that it is in Australia’s interests to keep to an internationally agreed goal of limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial times, noting that if this limit is breached, the Great Barrier Reef will be greatly diminished, the number of heatwaves will soar and southern Australia could face an 18% drop in spring rainfall by 2090.\nBernie Fraser, chairman of the CCA, said that if the 30% target was adopted, Australia would still be an “outlier” in terms of high per capita emissions but it would gain credibility at the Paris talks.\n“This would likely be considered the behaviour of a good global citizen, and go some way to answering those who have questioned Australia’s commitment to climate change policy in recent times,” he said. “It would also give Australia the right to expect other countries to behave in like fashion.”\nHowever, Fraser said that Australia will have to work hard to catch up with other countries and that failure to beef up the current climate policy – which several experts doubt will achieve the 5% goal – will make it “pretty challenging” for the country to meet a 30% reduction target by 2025.\n“We are starting behind others in this race and the others aren’t slowing down,” he said. “The US and others are planning to increase the pace of their gallop.\n“If Australia were to put together an effective package of measures, we could get to the 30% target.”\nThe CCA has previously raised doubts over whether Direct Action, which pays businesses that wish to reduce their emissions, will ensure the 2020 target is met but Fraser said it may be enough due to “slackness” in the economy, which pushes down energy consumption.\nIt remains to be seen how closely the government will ponder the CCA’s recommendations, given that it tried and failed to scrap the advisory body.\n“We haven’t got a very good strike rate,” Fraser said. “We did recommend a rather more ambitious target than the minus 5%, but that didn’t get much of a run.\n“We recommended that the large scale renewable energy target scheme remain at 41,000 gigawatt hours and that didn’t get much favour. So that’s two strikes and we’ve stepped up to the plate for a third time. Let’s see what happens this time.”\nThe CCA will produce further reports on the costs and methods of achieving its recommended emissions reduction.",

        "conteudo": "It's a sight to behold. Just off Lagos, Nigeria's coast, an artificial island is emerging from the sea. A foundation, built of sand dredged from the ocean floor, stretches over ten kilometres. Promotional videos depict what is to come: a city of soaring buildings, housing for 250,000 people, and a central boulevard to match Paris' Champs-Élysées and New York's Fifth Avenue. Privately constructed, it will also be privately administered and supplied with electricity, water, mass transit, sewage and security. It is the \"future Hong Kong of Africa,\" anticipates Nigeria's World Bank director.\nWelcome to Eko Atlantic, a city whose \"whole purpose\", its developers say, is to \"arrest the ocean's encroachment.\" Like many low-lying coastal African countries, Nigeria has been hit hard by a rising sea-level, which has regularly washed away thousands of peoples' homes. To defend against the coastal erosion and flooding, the city is being surrounded by the \"Great Wall of Lagos\", a sea defence barrier made of 100,000 five-ton concrete blocks. Eko Atlantic will be a \"sustainable city, clean and energy efficient with minimal carbon emissions,\" offer jobs, prosperity and new land for Nigerians, and serve as a bulwark in the fight against the impacts of climate change.\nAt least that's the official story. Other facts suggest this gleaming city will be a menacing allure to most. In congested Lagos, Africa's largest city, there is little employment and millions work and scavenge in a vast, desperate informal economy. Sixty percent of Nigeria's population – almost 100 of 170 million people – live on less than a dollar a day. Preventable diseases are widespread; electricity and clean water hard to come by. A few kilometres down the Lagos shoreline, Nigerians eke out an existence in the aquatic slum of Makoko, built precariously on stilts over the ocean. Casting them as crime-ridden, the government regularly dismantles such slums, bulldozing homes and evicting thousands. These are hardly the people who will scoop up square footage in Eko Atlantic's pricy new high-rises.\nThose behind the project – a pair of politically connected Lebanese brothers who run a financial empire called the Chagoury Group, and a slew of African and international banks – give a picture of who will be catered to. Gilbert Chaougry was a close advisor to the notorious Nigerian dictatorship of the mid 1990s, helping the ultra-corrupt general Sani Abacha as he looted billions from public coffers. Abacha killed hundreds of demonstrators and executed environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa, who rose to fame protesting the despoiling of the country by Shell and other multinational oil corporations. Thus it's fitting for whom the first 15-story office tower in Eko Atlantic is being built: a British oil and gas trading company. The city proposing to head off environmental devastation will be populated by those most responsible for it in the first place.\nEko Atlantic city will sit on ten million square metres of land built of sand dredged from the Atlantic Ocean. Photograph: Eko Atlantic\nThe real inspiration for Eko Atlantic comes not from these men but the dreamworlds of rampant capitalism, stoked by a successful, thirty year global campaign to claw back gains in social security and unchain corporations from regulation – what we now know as neoliberalism. In Nigeria, oil wealth plundered by a military elite spawned extreme inequalities and upended the economy. Under the IMF's neoliberal dictates, the situation worsened: education and healthcare were gutted, industries privatized, and farmers ruined by western products dumped on their markets. The World Bank celebrated Nigeria; extreme poverty doubled. The most notorious application of the power of the Nigerian state for the interest of the rich came in 1990: an entire district of Lagos - 300,000 homes – was razed to clear the way for high-end real-estate development.\nAs elites in Nigeria and elsewhere have embraced such inequality as the very engine of growth, they have re-established some of the most severe forms of colonial segregation and gated leisure. Today, boutiques cannot open fast enough to serve the Nigerian millionaires buying luxury cars and yachts they'll be able to dock in Eko Atlantic's down-town marina. Meanwhile, thousands of people who live in communities along the coast expect the new city will bring displacement, not prosperity, says environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey. To get their way, the developers, backed by industry and politicians, have trampled over the country's environmental assessment process. \"Building Eko Atlantic is contrary to anything one would want to do if one took seriously climate change and resource depletion,\" he says.\nThe wealthy and powerful may in fact take climate change seriously: not as a demand to modify their behaviour or question the fossil-fuel driven global economy that has made it possible, but as the biggest opportunity yet to realize their dreams of unfettered accumulation and consumption. The disaster capitalists behind Eko Atlantic have seized on climate change to push through pro-corporate plans to build a city of their dreams, an architectural insult to the daily circumstances of ordinary Nigerians. The criminalized poor abandoned outside their walls may once have served as sufficient justification for their flight and fortification – but now they have the very real threat of climate change as well.\nEko Atlantic is where you can begin to see a possible future – a vision of privatized green enclaves for the ultra rich ringed by slums lacking water or electricity, in which a surplus population scramble for depleting resources and shelter to fend off the coming floods and storms. Protected by guards, guns, and an insurmountable gully – real estate prices – the rich will shield themselves from the rising tides of poverty and a sea that is literally rising. A world in which the rich and powerful exploit the global ecological crisis to widen and entrench already extreme inequalities and seal themselves off from its impacts – this is climate apartheid.\nPrepare for the elite, like never before, to use climate change to transform neighbourhoods, cities, even entire nations into heavily fortified islands. Already, around the world, from Afghanistan to Arizona, China to Cairo, and in mushrooming mega-cities much like Lagos, those able are moving to areas where they can live better and often more greenly – with better transport and renewable technologies, green buildings and ecological services. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the super-rich – ferried above the congested city by a fleet of hundreds of helicopters – have disembedded themselves from urban life, attempting to escape from a common fate.\nIn places like Eko Atlantic the escape, a moral and social secession of the rich from those in their country, will be complete. This essentially utopian drive – to consume rapaciously and endlessly and to reject any semblance of collective impulse and concern – is simply incompatible with human survival. But at the moment when we must confront an economy and ideology pushing the planet's life-support systems to breaking point, this is what the neoliberal imagination offers us: a grotesque monument to the ultra-rich flight from responsibility.\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.\nA counter-point to Eko Atlantic, Nigerian architect Kunle Adeyemi has designed floating structures for the Makoko slum that are buoyed by plastic barrels and powered by solar panels.\nThere are, however, alternatives, like one proposed for the Makoko slum, the home of a quarter-million Nigerians – the same number who are intended to inhabit Eko Atlantic. Nigerian architect Kunle Adeyemi has designed what amounts to a counter-point, a floating settlement of which a school has already been built – making it only the second school that Makoko has ever had. The floating structures – made of low-cost wood and buoyed by recycled plastic barrels – have solar panels, sloped roofs to harvest rainwater, and compost toilets to solve dire sanitary needs.\nNnimmo Bassey thinks the floating settlements are just the thing to help the sustainable development of under-served communities across Nigeria's coastlines. \"It is a structure that suits the environment, is easy to replicate and appropriate to peoples' lifestyle, and is sensitive to the challenges of sea level rise,\" he says. \"It would help create what we need: communities for people, not gated anti-people communities.\"\nThe project is animated by a very different vision: that we must share rather than hoard, reduce inequality rather than increase it, and encourage the resiliency of everyone rather than the escape from the worst for a few. That the needs of the most vulnerable, rather than the desires of the most wealthy, must be the starting point of any effort to truly combat the climate crisis.\nThe choices before Lagos confront us all. While ours is not the first civilization whose elites have proved spectacularly indifferent to collective, ecological survival, it is up to us whether we will be the last.\nFollow Martin on twitter: @Martin_Lukacs",

        "conteudo": "The entire five-year period of the European Union's emissions trading scheme (ETS) that ends in 2012 is set to deliver carbon savings of less than a third of 1% of total emissions, according to a new report.\nThe analysis by emissions trading campaign group Sandbag predicts that only 32m tonnes of pollution permits will need to be surrendered to meet the cap on greenhouse gas emissions – a tiny fraction of the 1.9bn tonnes of carbon emissions covered by the ETS each year. The \"miniscule\" saving is the result of the economic crisis having driven down industrial activity while the caps remain at the same level.\n\"The ETS is the best thing we have but it is being held back by industry lobbying,\" said Sandbag's founder, Bryony Worthington. \"We think the European commission wants to lower the caps but they need to win the political battle. As it stands, no one needs to do anything to curb their emissions until about 2016 – the ETS is locking Europe into a carbon trap rather than a carbon cap.\"\nThe report also finds that the number of \"hot air\" permits held by steel and cement manufacturers has risen sharply. These permits were awarded in anticipation of high levels of production, but since the recession has caused production to crash, the companies no longer need the permits. They can sell them on the open market or hoard them until the next ETS phase, when the carbon price may have risen. In 2009, the top 10 holders of surplus permits had 119m – four times the number of the previous year.\nIn Sandbag's projections, which assume an economic recovery and a return to 2008 levels of emissions in 2011, the biggest holder of hot air, steel-maker ArcelorMittal, will have amassed over 100m permits, worth over £1.5bn at today's price. The next three biggest in the list, Lafarge, Corus and Cemex, are predicted to have over 78m surplus permits between them by 2012.\n\"We do not know how many CO2 allowances we will end up with at the end of 2012 because it depends on the market developments in the next years,\" an ArcelorMittal spokesperson said. \"In any event, we will not sell CO2 allowances we have received from governments as we will need them for future production needs or, alternatively, we will invest them in energy efficiency projects in our plants. Therefore, any surplus allowances we will have by end 2012 do not constitute a windfall profit.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said: \"We agree that in phase II of the EU ETS [2008-2012] the cap on European emissions is not tight enough, which is why under the revised EU ETS from 2013 there will be a much tighter cap.\"\nHowever, Sandbag goes further, arguing that the 1.8bn permits likely to be carried over into the new phase in 2013 means carbon emissions could rise to a third higher than current levels, seriously undermining the attractiveness of investment in low-carbon technology.\nOne solution, said Sandbag, is to reset the caps based on the actual levels of carbon being emitted – not the levels predicted before the recession – and cancel hot air permits. Another, backed by Decc, is for the EU to increase its 2020 carbon reduction target from 20% to 30%, as it would have done at the Copenhagen climate change summit last year if other nations had made similar commitments.\n\"The coalition government is pushing the EU to demonstrate leadership in tackling international climate change, including an increase in the EU emission reduction target to 30% by 2020,\" said the Decc spokesperson. \"This would lead to a significant tightening of the EU ETS cap, improve the way the EU ETS works and, in our view, substantially address many of the concerns raised by Sandbag.\"\nBoth industrial and steel lobby groups, Business Europe and Eurofer, have opposed changes to the ETS, saying it would put jobs at risk. In April, a UK steel company executive told the Guardian that a tighter ETS cap would be \"death by a thousand cuts\" for the industry.",

The loss of summer sea ice has led to unusual warming of the Arctic atmosphere, that in turn impacts weather patterns in the northern hemisphere, that can result in persistent extreme weather such as droughts, heatwaves and flooding,\" she said.\nArctic sea ice extent for September 16, 2012 was 3.41m sq km. The orange line shows the 1979 to 2000 median extent for that day. The black cross indicates the geographic North Pole. Photograph: National Snow and Ice Data Center\nOther leading ice scientists this week predicted the complete collapse of sea ice in the Arctic within four years. \"The final collapse ... is now happening and will probably be complete by 2015/16,\" said Prof Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University.\nSea ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of global climate change because of its sensitivity to warming and its role in amplifying climate change. According to Nsidc, the warming of Arctic areas is now increasing at around 10% a decade.\nAlong with the extent of the sea ice, its thickness, or volume, has also significantly decreased in the last two decades. While this is harder to measure accurately, it is believed to have decreased around 40% since 1979.\nThe collapse of the ice cap was last night interpreted by environment groups as a signal of long-term climate warming caused by man.\n\"I hope that future generations will mark this day as a turning point, when a new spirit of global cooperation emerged to tackle the huge challenges we face. We must work together to protect the Arctic from the effects of climate change and unchecked corporate greed. This is now the defining environmental battle of our era,\" said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International.\nOther groups called on the UK government, and industries across the world to heed the warning signs from the Arctic and act \"with urgency and ambition\" to tackle climate change.\nRod Downie, polar expert at WWF-UK said: \"With the speed of change we are now witnessing in the Arctic, the UK government must show national and global leadership in the urgent transition away from fossil fuels to a low carbon economy.\n\"This is further evidence that Shell's pursuit of hydrocarbons in the Arctic is reckless. It is completely irresponsible to drill for oil in such a fragile environment; there are simply too many unmanageable risks.\"\nAuthor and environmental campaigner Bill McKibben said: \"Our response [so far] has not been alarm, or panic, or a sense of emergency. It has been: 'Let's go up there and drill for oil'. There is no more perfect indictment of our failure to get to grips with the greatest problem we've ever faced.\"\nArctic sea ice follows an annual cycle of melting through the warm summer months and refreezing in the winter. It has shown a dramatic overall decline over the past 30 years.\nSea ice is known to play a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the sun's energy, helping to cool the Earth.\nThe UN Environment programme warned that the extra shipping and industry likely to result from the thawing of sea ice could further accelerate sea ice melting.\n\"There is an urgent need to calculate risks of local pollutants such as soot, or black carbon, in the Arctic. Soot darkens ice, making it soak up more of the sun's heat and quickening a melt,\" said UNEP spokesman Nick Nuttall in Nairobi.\n• This article and its headline were amended on 20 September. The original wrongly said the ice extent had shrunk 18% in a year; this has been corrected to reflect the 18% decrease was 2012 against 2007, not 2012 against 2011.",

        "conteudo": "The robotic lander that touched down on a comet on Wednesday came to rest on its side in the shadow of a cliff, according to the first data beamed home from the probe.\nPictures from cameras on board the European Space Agency’s Philae lander show the machine with one foot in the sky and lodged against a high cliff face that is blocking sunlight to its solar panels.\nThe precarious resting place means mission controllers are faced with some tough decisions over whether to try and nudge the spacecraft into a sunnier spot. If successful, that would allow Philae to fully recharge its batteries and do more science on the comet, but any sudden move could risk toppling the lander over, or worse, knock it off the comet completely.\nThe washing machine-sized lander was released by its Rosetta mother ship at 0835am GMT on Wednesday morning and touched down at a perfect spot on the comet’s surface. But when anchoring harpoons failed to fire, the probe bounced back off into space. So weak is the gravitational pull of the comet that Philae soared 1km into the sky and did not come down again until two hours later. “We made quite a leap,” said Stephan Ulamec, the Philae lander manager.\nIn the time it took the probe to land for the second time, the comet had rotated, bringing more treacherous terrain underneath. The spacecraft bounced a second time and finally came to a standstill on its side at what may be the rim of an enormous crater. Technically, the agency pulled off not only the first landing on a comet in history, but the second and third too.\n“We bounced twice and stopped in a place we’ve not entirely located,” said Jean-Pierre Bibring, Philae’s lead scientist. Teams of scientists are now trying to work out where the probe is. What mission controllers do know is that they are not where they hoped to be. “We are exactly below a cliff, so we are in a shadow permanently,” Bibring added.\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSpace lander sends first image of landing – video\nWith most of Philae in the dark, the lander will receive only a fraction of the solar energy that Esa had hoped for. The spacecraft needs six or seven hours of sunlight a day but is expected to receive just one and a half. Though it can operate for 60 hours on primary batteries, the probe must then switch to its main batteries which need to be recharged through its solar arrays. If Philae’s batteries run out it will go into a hibernation mode until they have more power.\nThe spacecraft was designed with landing gear that could hop the probe around, but from its awkward position on its side the option is considered too risky.\nThough caught in a tight spot, the Philae lander’s systems appear to be working well. The Rosetta spacecraft picked up the lander’s signal on Thursday morning and received the first images and more instrument data from the surface of the comet.\nOne of Philae’s major scientific goals is to analyse the comet for organic molecules. To do that, the lander must get samples from the comet into several different instruments, named Ptolemy, Cosac and Civa. There are two ways to do this: sniffing and drilling. Sniffing involves opening the instruments to allow molecules from the surface to drift inside. The instruments are already doing this and returning data.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPanoramic view around the point of Philae’s final touchdown on the surface of comet 67P, taken when Rosetta was about 18km from centre of comet. Parts of Philae’s landing gear can be seen in this picture. Photograph: European Space Agency/AFP/Getty Images\nDrilling is much riskier because it could make the lander topple over. Newton’s third law of motion says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the minuscule gravity of the comet, any movement on Philae will cause motion. The drill turning one way will make Philae want to turn the other. Pushing down into the surface will push the lander off again. “We don’t want to start drilling and end the mission,” said Bibring.\nBut the team has decided to operate another moving instrument, named Mupus, on Thursday evening. This could cause Philae to shift, but calculations show that it would be in a direction that could improve the amount of sunlight falling on the probe. A change in angle of only a few degrees could help. A new panoramic image will be taken after the Mupus deployment to see if there has been any movement.\n\">\nMeanwhile, the Rosetta orbiter team will continue to try to pinpoint Philae’s position. This will be done with images from the mother ship’s Osiris wide-angle camera and its Concert radar instrument. The Concert instrument communicates with Philae and is designed to beam radar through the interior of the comet to reveal the internal structure. When Rosetta is directly overhead, Concert can also help to pinpoint the lander’s position. “When we see where we are, we can decide what to do next,” said Bibring.\nBut time is tight, the first 24 hours of the battery life will soon be gone. It is expected to be completely drained sometime on Saturday. “We are running against the clock,” admits Bibring, “Don’t put the emphasis on failure, it is gorgeous where we are.”",

        "conteudo": "Six years ago, Laurence Kemball-Cook had a brainwave. A graduate of Loughborough university, he was doing a placement year at the energy company Eon, where he was given the job of finding a way to power street lighting with solar energy and wind. It didn’t work, he says, in part because there’s a lot of shade in cities. This got him thinking about other potential sources of power in busy urban spaces. The answer, he realised, was underneath his feet.\n“My idea was a floor tile that would convert the kinetic energy from a footstep into electricity,” he says. “Every time someone steps on the tile, they generate seven watts of power. The energy is stored within batteries, and then used to power lighting when it’s needed. It’s an off-grid power source for cities.” We are talking in the headquarters of Pavegen in King’s Cross. He set up the company in 2009 but it took several years to develop the technology and convince people to take it on. His first installation was unorthodox, to say the least. “Investors wouldn’t invest without tiles in the ground, so I broke into a building site on the south bank of the Thames at 2am, installed the product illegally, took photos and put them on our website saying: ‘Celebrating our latest installation.’ I closed a deal with Westfield pretty soon after that.”\nSince then, Pavegen has worked with brands such as Coca-Cola and Siemens. The company has tiles at Heathrow terminal three and are planning an installation outside the White House. During last year’s World Cup, it went into a favela in Rio and laid a whole football pitch with tiles, hooking them up to spotlights so that play could continue after dark.\nLight isn’t the only thing it generates. When Kemball-Cook and I have a go on the demo tiles in the Pavegen office, our jumping around causes a radio to turn on. And there’s another, potentially more powerful application. “When you stand on a tile, it sends out wireless data. This is useful for crowdflow modelling – seeing how people move through cities. You can use it to control lighting more efficiently. It’s also a really key way for retailers to know how many people are visiting their shops. We imagine Google will cover streets with this in the future and use the data in interesting ways.”\nPavegen’s product, which looks like a regular floor tile until you lift the rubber (or Astroturf) surface and see the hub of circuitry within, is manufactured in eastern Europe. “We didn’t find the Far East was viable for us,” says Kemball-Cook. He cites concerns over IP violation, shipping times and travel costs as reasons for choosing a manufacturing hub closer to home. In eastern Europe: “There’s a really strong industrial base and a we-can-fix-it attitude,” he says.\nThe company has now has 30 employees and a second office in Los Angeles. But Kemball-Cook acknowledges there’s still a long way to go. One major obstacle is price – it costs around £1,250 to cover one square metre of ground with Pavegen tiles. “The holy grail for us is to make our product the same cost as normal flooring,” he says.\n“It takes a lot of time and investment to get there,” he adds. “Solar took 58 years to get to the point it’s at now. I reckon we’ve done about the first 20 years with our technology. Our investors know it’s not an overnight play. We are establishing a whole industry that never existed before.”",

        "conteudo": "The scene outside the cab window is ominous: six lanes of black sedans, apple-green buses and scooters sit crammed fender-to-fender, their shrill horns and screeching brakes piercing Seoul's hazy, exhaust-choked air. Before one even arrives in Songdo, it's easy to understand its appeal.\nOver the past decade, the South Korean city of Songdo has sprung up on 600 hectares of reclaimed land on the Yellow Sea, 65km south of Seoul. Linked by a 12km bridge to Incheon International Airport, the city is hailed as an experimental prototype of the aerotropolis, an urban development concept with the potential to significantly affect the way we travel.\nWhat is an aerotropolis? At its simplest, it's a city built around an airport. Instead of sticking an airport on the outskirts of an existing city, building a city around the airport allows for faster movement of goods and people. And as Greg Lindsay, co-author of Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next, argues, in the era of globalisation, efficiency is the key. Lindsay believes that the old real-estate rule of \"location, location, location\" is being swapped for the new rule of \"accessibility, accessibility, accessibility\".\n\"Cities have always formed around transportation – ports and harbours and then train stations,\" says Lindsay, pointing to Boston, New York and Chicago as examples. \"Air travel is the only way to connect globally, and now, more frequently, cities will grow around airports.\"\nEven 10 years ago, when Songdo's development first began, the aerotropolis wasn't a well-known notion. \"We weren't cognisant of the aerotropolis concept at the time,\" says Jonathan Thorpe, senior executive vice-president and chief investment officer of Gale International, the development firm behind Songdo. \"It just made sense.\"\nIn 2001, South Korea approached the New York-based firm about developing a city that, by virtue of its proximity to the newly opened airport in Incheon, would attract multinational corporations and potentially turn the region into the world's gateway to north-east Asia. \"The idea was that it would be an international business district and that foreigners would find this a convenient place to set up business,\" says Thomas Hubbard, who served as US ambassador to South Korea when the project began. \"The model was Singapore.\"\nUnderstanding the mission of attracting new western business, Gale has built state-of-the-art, high-tech office buildings, apartments, shops and schools, imported elements from other cities, such as New York's Central Park, and wooed Jack Nicklaus into building one of his iconic golf clubs.\nMuch of Songdo has still to be built, but even as it is under continuing construction, there are signs that point to its becoming an important business and residential hub. Last autumn, the UN selected the city as the home of its new Green Climate Fund agency. Initial estimates expect 500 employees and their families to move to Songdo.\nWhile Songdo's status as a sustainable city helped in its successful bid to house the Green Climate Fund, so did its proximity to Incheon International Airport. \"You land at the airport and there's a convention centre, a hotel, a golf course,\" says Lindsay. \"Business travellers already live out of conference hotels; now you're seeing conference cities. You still go to Seoul if you have leisure time, but this is the hyper-efficient movement of people. This is taking the scale of business travel to the extreme.\"\nIf accessibility and efficiency are key to the business traveller, the aerotropolis's impact is clear. In some instances, the effect on leisure traveller is equally, garishly obvious.\nAcross the bridge from Songdo, Incheon airport is building a massive playland to rival Macau and Las Vegas. It is already the No 1 duty-free airport in the world, with $1.53bn in sales last year.\nOutside the terminal, on the man-made island where it sits, development is underway on a mega-resort and casino, a water park, a shopping mall and several hotels. By the end of the decade, this new pleasure carnival will open and connect back to the airport by a magnetic levitation train that will make a 33-mile loop around the entire island.\n\"The concept of an airport is changing,\" says Min-Jae Chun, director of the Airport City Development Group. \"In the past it was just about transportation. If you want to progress, you have to create a destination.\"\nA quarter of the world's population is within three-and-a-half hours of Incheon, and by 2018, the airport anticipates 62 million visitors a year, with 65% coming from Japan and China. \"These cities are being built as tourism infrastructure for people who can now afford to travel,\" says Lindsay. \"These are the mega-resorts for the world's emerging middle class.\"\nThe aerotropolis, however, does cause other, less readily obvious ripples in how we travel. \"Once you build these infrastructures and you make travel more efficient, you change global travel patterns,\" says Lindsay. \"It opens up places. It makes it easier to create hubs and connect. It leads to a rise in travel destinations we never thought of before or that were really difficult to get to.\"\nHe points to Dubai as the ultimate example. \"It was barely on the map 20 years ago,\" he says. But after spending $500m on a new concourse, and after Emirates airline acquired several new long-haul jets, the city became an important hub, linking places that had never been connected before.\n\"The Seychelles becomes easier to reach because you can stop over in Dubai,\" says Lindsay.\n\"In Africa there are 14 aerotropolises being built. And in places like the Middle East and Asia, people are sitting down and building cities from scratch around the airport. China alone is building the equivalent of Rome every week. It will be interesting to see what destinations open up.\"\n• This article appeared in the Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from the Washington Post",

        "conteudo": "The Conservative party is planning to pledge in its manifesto for next year's general election that it will introduce a moratorium on future onshore windfarms from 2020 on the grounds that they have now become \"self-defeating\".\nIn an attempt to show that David Cameron is not abandoning the green agenda, the Tories will also pledge in their 2015 manifesto to press ahead with an intensification of offshore windfarms.\nThe manifesto will also focus on greater use of solar power, a point highlighted when the government unveiled plans this week to encourage England's 22,000 schools to install solar panels and other measures to improve energy efficiency.\nThe decision to refocus the emphasis on offshore wind – and to abandon support for future onshore windfarms – follows an intense debate among senior Tories and between the coalition partners over the future of Britain's renewable energy resources.\nA senior source close to the prime minister told the Guardian this week that Cameron is supportive of opponents of onshore windfarms and wants to \"go further\" in cutting financial aid to them.\nA move by Cameron and George Osborne to push for a cap on the electricity output of onshore windfarms, which would in effect amount to a cap, was rejected by Nick Clegg.\nThe Guardian understands that Cameron has brokered a compromise between warring Tories by agreeing to include measures in the manifesto for next year's general election that will in effect rule out the building of onshore windfarms from 2020. \"We are likely to see that in the Conservative manifesto,\" one senior Tory said of the measures, which would amount to a moratorium.\nThe Tories will be working out the details of the pledge, which could involve an absolute cap on the output from onshore turbines. Lesser measures, which would all come into force in 2020, would involve lower subsidies or introducing tighter planning restrictions.\nThe senior Conservative said it was important to act because onshore windfarms had become so unpopular.\nThe Tory source said: \"We are not going to allow the Lib Dems to characterise us as anti-clean-energy just because we want to control the number of onshore windfarms. If anything we are mindful that uncontrolled expansion of onshore wind is alienating people from the whole clean energy debate. We think it is self-defeating.\"\nThe government believes it is on course to meet its energy forecasts outlined by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. But the source added: \"After 2020 we really want to see the emphasis on offshore wind. The emphasis will shift but not completely.\n\"We want to deliver the wind that's obviously been built already, that's currently in the planning system, that's currently in construction. But when that current pipeline is deployed by 2020 we want to see the emphasis shift to offshore wind. Solar can also help take up the slack.\"\nThe revelation that the Tories will abandon support for onshore windfarms comes after Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Greg Barker, the climate change minister, outlined ambitions to encourage all 22,000 schools in England to install solar panels.\nSchools would fund the installation of solar power, which can cost around £10,000, by accessing feed-in tariffs which would be used to pay off the capital costs, which could take up to 10 years.\nBarker said: \"This ambitious new roll-out of solar on our schools is another example of the coalition walking the walk, not just talking the talk on the green agenda. Schools have a particularly iconic role at the heart of communities so as well as joining the clean energy transition and helping lower our emissions, schools and their pupils can help inspire thousands of others to take action too.\"\nGove said: \"Solar panels are a sensible choice for schools, particularly in terms of the financial benefits they can bring. It is also a great way for pupils to engage with environmental issues and think about where energy comes from.\"\nFriends of the Earth welcomed the announcement. Andy Atkins, the executive director, said: \"It's encouraging to see the prime minister's Conservative colleagues promoting a positive solar vision for the UK and as a solution to climate change, particularly when it comes just days after David Cameron took a swipe at onshore windfarms. Clean, renewable power like solar is our future, and with Greg Barker rightly pointing out that it will soon be cheaper than gas, we need the whole of government to move fast to ensure solar projects everywhere can rapidly take off.\"",

        "conteudo": "The eco audit\nWill Tory plans kill onshore wind in the UK?\nEnergy minister Michael Fallon says the UK has enough onshore wind. Will new plans to pull subsidies and change planning permission mean the end of the industry?\nJoin the debate. Post your views in the comments below, email karl.mathiesen.freelance@guardian.co.uk or tweet @karlmathiesen\nUpdated\nThursday 24 April 2014 12.15 EDT\nLast modified on Tuesday 4 August 2015 05.36 EDT\n12:10\nMy verdict\nThere seems to be little doubt that this policy will eventually sink the onshore wind industry in this country. The potential for the technology to compete without subsidies is poor and the handing over of power to local authorities will likely be the final nail in the industry's coffin.\nTories and many industry leaders are loath to admit that this will put an end to onshore wind, saying that current capacity will be maintained and even grow for a time as projects granted permission before 2015 come online. But what industry survives without long-term growth? For onshore wind to continue to generate investment in research and development (and therefore to stay competitive) it will need to have the potential for new growth and projects. As Jennifer Webber, from RenewableUK says , this policy \"will kill the industry dead\".\nThat is their prerogative, especially if the EU fails to introduce a 2030 renewable energy target as some observers are suggesting they will. But the Committee on Climate Change says the level of onshore wind will need to more than triple by 2030 if the UK is to meet its own emissions reduction commitments.\nDavid Cameron said the policy was a removal of unnecessary subsidies. But this argument washes away quickly when you consider that onshore wind is less expensive than other renewable alternatives, which will continue to attract public funding.\nWhat this is really about is votes in rural areas and an appeal to the NIMBYism that sways the Tory right towards Ukip. In the end, windfarms, like migrant workers and the EU, are seen as alien edifices being imposed on the British way of life. Renewable energy creates jobs, but it fails to create them in the areas where it changes the skyline. Thus locals feel the costs outweigh the benefits. The majority of Brits are for windfarms, but the Tories have decided that the votes they need are not only opposed, but they are so strongly opposed they will decide their vote on it.\nUpdated\n11:33\nCameron comments\nPrime minister David Cameron has weighed into the debate, telling Sky News this is not the end of onshore wind but we \"won't see lots of new large-scale wind farm developments\".\n\"Onshore wind has an important role to play in generating electricity in our country. We want a varied supply of electricity.\n\"We are going to be having a decent amount of onshore wind but the fact is we don't need any more than what we have got in the planning system.\n\"We have now got enough to meet targets, make sure our energy is diversified.\n\"I have always said we shouldn't keep subsidies for longer than is necessary.\n\"I am saying a future Conservative government would no longer subsidise onshore wind and have a proper system in the planning system so that local views are paramount, rather than being overridden by national imperatives.\n\"It's not the end of onshore wind it will make an important contribution to our country's electricity but you won't see lots of new large-scale wind farm developments.\n\"What we have got in the planning system and already built is enough to provide for our needs.\"\nUpdated\n— Karl Mathiesen (@KarlMathiesen) April 24, 2014\nAll 2050 80% GHG reduction scenarios require onshore wind capacity to double. Source: @theCCCuk , @carbonbrief pic.twitter.com/r5so5tWFgT\n\"But what if the UK did freeze onshore wind capacity?\" asks Webster.\nIt would certainly be possible for the UK to do so in 2020 and keep cutting carbon emissions for another three decades - but it would be a lot more expensive.\nThe government expects the cost of offshore wind to come down in the 2020s - but not enough to overtake onshore wind. Overall, investing in 10 GW of onshore wind in the 2020s rather than other less-developed clean technologies could save the economy two to three billion pounds, the CCC predicts.\nOr to put it another way - failing to invest in 10 GW of onshore wind could cost the country two to three billion pounds in the 2020s.\nBy 2030, onshore wind will still be cheaper to develop than offshore wind, and gas or coal power stations fitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the CCC says.\nThe Tories' plan to cap wind power could ensure tackling climate change will be more expensive, not less.\nUpdated\n10:50\nAngela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK , told reporters at the Guardian this afternoon that this policy would not kill the onshore wind industry because existing plants would remain operational. However she did not say new plants would continue to be built. She said the Conservatives were responding to local concerns that were not taken into account when onshore wind policy was formulated in 2008 and that there had been a sustained campaign against onshore wind inside the Tory party.\n\"I don't think it's much of a surprise because it follows concerns raised by MPs in the Houses of Parliament,\" she said.\nShe also commented on the numbers of jobs brought to local areas by different energy technologies. \"For coal power stations you're talking thousands of jobs, gas it goes down to a few hundred and renewables it is just the supply chain.\" This could indicate why wind power is so susceptible to local concerns as its employment benefits are not necessarily located in the region.\nUpdated\n09:19\nPolitical reaction\nLiberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey said the party would continue to fight their coalition partners on onshore wind.\n“We have already fought the Conservatives over capping onshore wind in this Government – and won.\n“Putting the brakes on onshore wind would be disastrous for business and jobs in our growing green economy. Onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of green energy, so cutting it could lead to higher bills.\n“You can’t trust the Conservatives on their own to build a fairer society. Only with Liberal Democrats in Government can we build a stronger economy and a fairer society.”\nJulian Smith, Tory MP for Skipton & Ripon said today that the policy was the fulfilment of a long campaign by rural Tories whose constituents disliked the aesthetic impact of windfarms.\n\"I am delighted for all the communities across my constituency, North Yorkshire and the country who have been given this fantastic commitment by the Conservatives. Ending future subsidies and adding planning powers to allow communities to say 'no' are sensible and responsible moves and the result of years of campaigning by Conservative MPs representing the concerns of their constituents, the majority of whom have totally had their fill of wind.\"\nHis Conservative colleagues Stewart Jackson and Glyn Davies agree.\n— Glyn Davies (@GlynDaviesMP) April 23, 2014\nAt long last. A Tory Govt says \"enough is enough\" to energy giants determined to destroy British landscapes with hideous wind turbines.\nGreen Party environment spokesperson, Andrew Cooper, said:\n“What we really need to know from the Tories is how they intend to achieve the renewable energy targets we are signed up for with the EU. Only Malta and Luxembourg have a worse record on renewables with the UK. The coalition has cut spending on energy conservation meaning we will have to find more energy in more expensive ways. This is a government without an energy strategy.”\nUpdated\nMore industry reaction\nGreen energy entrepreneur and Ecotricity founder Dale Vince said today :\n“Before the last election, David Cameron promised to lead the greenest government ever - that promise lies in tatters now, as he prepares to fight the next election dancing to the tune set by UKIP.\n“It's a shameful abdication of his responsibility as prime minister, to put his party before the country in this way.\n“We need an energy policy that makes sense, environmentally and economically, one that can give us energy independence, lower bills and abate climate change. What we have instead is one that only makes sense politically, an energy policy for the Tory party.\n“Last week’s YouGov poll shows very clearly that wind energy onshore is overwhelmingly popular, contrary to Cameron's claims today.\n“The same poll shows that we Briton's would rather have a windmill in our neighbourhood than we would a fracking rig - by an overwhelming three to one.\"\nRenewable Energy Association head of public affairs James Court said:\n“This kind of nakedly political positioning from the Conservatives undermines all the positive work this Government has put into renewables. The shale gas industry has Government’s unwavering support, and yet according to its own figures its potential for jobs is less than the renewables industry already achieves in the UK.\n“Renewables are delivering today, while any potential benefits from shale gas are still some way off. Renewable energy is attracting investment, creating jobs, cutting costs, improving our energy security and preserving our environment. We urge the pragmatic wing of the Conservative Party to resist this political game-playing and make their voices heard in the debate.”\nThe Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales said the decision was particularly poorly timed after the IPCC report last week , which placed huge emphasis on the importance of renewable technologies in averting climate change.\n\"The effect of removing subsidies for onshore wind will be to seriously damage British industry and increase energy prices for consumers. Onshore wind energy is the cheapest source of renewable energy, which means with support cut a future government would have to rely on more expensive technologies - pushing energy prices up.\n\"The IPCC report last week showed that the world urgently needs to switch to renewable sources of energy. We need investment in all forms of renewable energy, but the government should in particular be supporting those that already have the capacity to deliver for Britain and have thousands of skilled workers for.\"\nRebecca O'Connor, editorial director for Trillion Fund , said:\n\"We should all feel cheated by Michael Fallon's insane decision to ban future onshore wind developments should the Conservatives win the next election. It goes against common sense in every conceivable way.\n\"Wind is cheap, clean and straightforward to install. Having more of it will reduce bills for everyone for the long-term. Having more of it will help clear up our air pollution problems and mitigate the effects of climate change. Having more of it makes us a better society and a better economy (especially if it is funded by us - so we can financially profit from it too) because the wind is a free, clean and infinite resource.\n\"It sets a disturbing precedent for democracy when a policy with such far-reaching ramifications for energy, the economy and the climate is made to pander to the views of an extreme few, against popular opinion.\"\nInvestors have told Reuters :\n\"The Conservative party's pledge was creating uncertainty for onshore wind investments beyond 2020, the year when Britain's target to generate 15 percent of its energy from green sources has to be met.\n\"\"(This announcement) reinforces questions about the prospects of renewable energy post-2020, when the current UK and EU frameworks expire,\" said Tom Murley, responsible for renewable energy funds at HgCapital.\"\nUpdated\n07:23\nCutting subsidies could cost money\nEarlier this month, Professor Richard Green, who is a member of a working group reviewing UK energy, told the BBC that removing subsidies from onshore windfarms would shift the focus to offshore wind costing taxpayers millions. Green said taxpayers would pay £300,000 for each turbine that shifted offshore.\nThe BBC reported:\nUnder government plans, onshore wind turbines will receive £90 per megawatt hour of electricity generated from 2017. But offshore turbines get more aid, around £140 per megawatt hour.\n\"That's about £300,000 per year per turbine that is moved from onshore to offshore,\" said Professor Green, who is an economist.\n\"That is the cost in additional subsidy, at the rates the government is planning to pay in about 2017. Those subsidies are recovered through electricity bills.\"\nFriends of the Earth energy campaigner Donna Hume said today that the policy made little economic sense.\n“Scrapping support for wind turbines would be bad news for jobs, energy bills and the environment.\n“Onshore wind has fallen dramatically in price – it already costs less than nuclear, and is set to be cheaper than gas in the next few years.\n“Scrapping wind subsidies, rather than phasing them out as costs fall, will simply lead to higher fuel bills for cash-strapped households and make it harder to tackle climate change.\"\n06:44\nFallon killing one industry while \"kickstarting\" another?\nMichael Fallon is having a busy day. He has announced the release of a report that says a shale gas boom in the UK could potentially bring in £33 billion and over 64,000 jobs.\nThe Business and energy minister said:\n“This report shows the huge prize at stake for the UK in terms of jobs and manufacturing in the supply chain for our onshore oil and gas industry.\n“Shale gas has the potential to kickstart a whole new industry, building on the world leading expertise the UK already has in the energy sector. There will be significant opportunities across the steel, manufacturing and engineering industries as shale develops.\n“This government is fully committed to ensuring the UK not only benefits from the energy security shale gas could provide but also maximising the economic benefit across the country. It’s time to get ready for shale.”\nUpdated\n06:20\nGreen groups reaction\nGreenpeace UK energy campaigner Louise Hutchins said the policy would shift the emphasis away from clean fuel technology.\n“This disastrous policy risks undermining our energy security, putting up bills, and wrecking efforts to stop climate change. Cutting incentives for wind power when we’re trying to reduce our reliance on energy imports is tantamount to self-sabotage – our suppliers of costly, polluting fossil fuels, including Putin, will be rubbing their hands.\n“UN scientists have just warned about the risks of climate change and the need for a massive clean energy shift, yet the Tory right wing seems to think this is happening on a different planet.\n“The hypocrisy is stunning. Our binding commitments on renewable energy will have to be met in the next Parliament, so excluding the cheapest source of clean energy can only drive up bills more than necessary. The Tories claim to be on the side of hard-working families, yet their pandering to a small minority who don’t like wind farms is raising energy costs for the rest of us.”\nBruce Davis, joint managing director of Abundance Generation says the decision was politically motivated and yet not backed by the majority of voters.\n\"Onshore wind is the cheapest, most efficient of the current crop of renewable energy technologies. This announcement seems to be more spin than substance but is no less damaging to investor confidence who are crying out for certainty and stability so that they can get on with the job of renewing the UK’s dirty and out of date energy infrastructure.\n\"What the Minister appears to be saying is that there is enough wind in the pipeline - i.e. he is not scrapping wind turbines but trying to placate a narrow minority of the Tory right who hate wind farms only slightly more than they hate immigration and benefits cheats.\n\"At Abundance, we know that the majority of UK voters support the growth of onshore wind, and the Minister’s own department surveys say the same thing. It is time the people were heard on this issue and energy policy decided on the basis of what is right for the country as a whole, rather than what the right wants for its minority vote.\"\nThe government's latest polling seems to agree. Two thirds of respondents supported onshore wind in the UK.\n— Charlotte Webster (@GoodShoutStudio) April 24, 2014\n@KarlMathiesen Results of Govt's public survey on attitude to wind energy Feb 2014. http://t.co/EuLZInCdxW pic.twitter.com/nB6uXoDFSu\nNick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at WWF-UK said:\n\"At a time where energy security and the cost of living are taking centre stage in UK politics, proposals to ban onshore wind, a reliable technology that has cut its cost globally by 43% in just four years, come across as highly irrational. While wind farms need to be carefully located, a recent YouGov poll showed that onshore wind was by far the preferred energy infrastructure that Britons would be prepared to host in their communities. These latest proposals on onshore wind reveal a deep misunderstanding of public opinion and the UK's energy security, consumer and environmental interests.\"\nUpdated\n05:41\n\"That would kill the industry dead\" - Wind industry reaction\nJennifer Webber, director of external affairs at RenewableUK , is adamant that onshore wind would not survive the Tories' assault.\n\"The onshore industry isn't in a place where it could cope without subsidies straight away. If subsidies were cut in 2015 as the minister is suggesting, that would kill the industry dead.\"\nShe says the freezing of the carbon price floor means that wind energy will not be able to compete with other subsidised energy production - such as nuclear.\nFallon says the UK already has enough onshore wind to meet the EU's 2020 commitments to greenhouse gas reductions and renewable energy. The EU Parliament is currently locked in debate on its 2030 targets. It is still unsure as to whether Europe will mandate targets for renewables or just emissions reductions. The lack of a renewables target would mean the Tories could shift more resources into their pet nuclear and carbon capture and storage technologies.\nWebber says \"it is difficult to be as definitive as the minister\" when discussing whether onshore wind has already reached the levels required to meet 2020 targets for renewable energy. She says there is growing concern that transport and heating are falling behind and that onshore wind will be required to make up the shortfall.\nShe also questions the assertion that there is a danger of the UK having too much onshore wind. While she says it is important to maintain a mix, there are many countries already running much higher densities of windfarms than the UK. She says the attraction of onshore wind is that it is a mature technology that is already cheaper than any other renewable and the price is still coming down. Removing subsidies from onshore wind might represent poor value for the public. \"To meet [2020] objectives you either need to use onshore wind or you use another technology where you get less bang for your buck.\"\nUpdated\nThe Telegraph reported that Miliband said:\n\"People always have to have the right to make their objections, planning issues and so on. I do think personally that we have got to embrace in general both offshore and onshore wind situated in the right way.\"\nHe said that the Conservative approach of having \"no more offshore wind\", which has been championed by John Hayes, a Tory minister without portfolio, is wrong.\n\"When I was finishing as energy secretary we were trying to get to a stage where we could map across the country where onshore wind would make a difference.\n\"One of the things people raise is not just we don't like i here, but is it going to make that much of a difference. I don't think we should take the John Hayes position, and say no more onshore wind. We will have manifesto commitments on green energy.\"\nUpdated\n04:44\nWelcome to the eco audit\nThe Conservatives will today announce plans to pull public funding of onshore windfarms and change the way planning permission is granted.\nEnergy minister Michael Fallon will say that if the Tories win the 2015 election any project that had not already been granted permission would not receive subsidies. Fallon justifies the policy by saying the UK already has enough onshore wind to meet its EU renewable energy commitments for 2020.\n\"Renewable energy, including onshore wind, has a key role in our future energy supply,\" he said.\n\"But we now have enough bill payer-funded onshore wind in the pipeline to meet our renewable energy commitments and there's no requirement for any more.\"\nHe also said responsibility for planning permission would be devolved to local authorities. This would give greater prevalence to local concerns and make it more difficult for projects to be realised. Currently large onshore wind projects are designated as \"nationally significant infrastructure\".\nThe Tories coalition partners are reportedly unhappy with the move. A Liberal Democrat source told the BBC that Fallon was courting the party right and trying to win votes from Ukip. Onshore wind is the cheapest form of renewable energy.\nThe policy comes in a big week for energy in the UK in which the government announced significant new offshore wind and biomass energy projects and changes to trespassing laws which will make it easier to gain permission for fracking.\nWhat would this policy mean for the onshore wind industry?

To achieve the decarbonisation we need to clean up our energy system, it's essential that the amount of low-carbon electricity we generate increases, so we hope to see the National Trust taking an equally pragmatic approach to the development of other large-scale renewable energy projects as well.\"\nThe trust already has more than 250 small and medium-scale renewable energy schemes at properties across England and Wales, including biomass boilers for heating castles and solar panels on stately homes.\nLast year it launched a £3.5m plan with Good Energy to provide clean energy to 43 historic properties, beginning with five pilot projects involving a marine source heat pump, two biomass boilers and two hydropower turbines.\nIt is hoped the scheme will help the charity to reduce energy use by 20%, generate half its energy from renewables sources by 2020 and halve fossil fuel use in the same period. This would save the charity £4m a year in energy costs that could be released for conservation work.\nThe trust says its policy is to \"consider opportunities to install renewable technology where it is appropriate and in the right location and scale for the landscape\".\nLast year the trust was reported to be fighting against 25 windfarm proposals that it said threatened stately homes and unspoilt landscape.\nThe trust says turbine is expected to generate 1,900 megawatt hours per year – enough electricity to power around 445 homes. Photograph: Keith Jones/NT\nA spokeswoman said the latest planning records showed the trust was currently objecting to 10 wind developments. \"This is largely due to the number, scale and location of the turbines in respect of the landscape. There are further live wind applications that we are commenting on, but we are not currently objecting to these.\"\nLast October the Times published a front-page story saying the National Trust had an \"open mind\" about fracking – but would not allow windfarms. But the chair, Dame Helen Ghosh, later said the headlines were misleading and the quotes selective.\nResponding to a blogpost by George Monbiot asking her to clarify her position, she wrote: \"We believe wind has a place in the clean energy portfolio but the 'kit' needs to work with the landscape – and it's our job to look after some very beautiful ones.\n\"We do have some small-scale wind on our land, and we don't always oppose windfarms, particularly if they meet the agreed environmental guidelines. But it's not for the trust to be the national planning authority for exactly where every renewable development goes.\"",

        "conteudo": "Households will be paying £100 more for their annual bills within five years to fund four government policies designed to keep the lights on and support low-carbon electricity, according to a review.\nIndependent consultancy Cornwall Energy said energy subsidies will have risen by 124% by 2020-21 due to the cost of the capacity market, renewable obligations, contracts for difference and feed-in tariff schemes.\nThe cost estimates will anger Conservative backbenchers opposed to subsidising green energy, even if it is designed to play a key role in the fight against climate change.\n“While the future path of wholesale prices remains uncertain, policy costs are moving only in one direction,” said Jo Butlin, the managing director of Cornwall.\n“Our research shows a confluence of factors serving to push these costs up notably in the next couple of years, though important drivers that could yet change the outlook remain beyond anyone’s control.”\nCornwall estimates that three of the renewable energy subsidies, excluding the capacity market energy security scheme, will have cost £7.7bn by 2020 – £100m more than the spending limit of the levy control framework.\nThe figure compares with an estimated £1.5bn overspend predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility last July.\nThe government said it had taken various steps to reduce the burden on customer bills in the past 12 months.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “Through the halting of subsidies for onshore wind in the [2013] Energy Act, to added competition driving down costs in contract for difference auctions and the capacity market, our actions have shown that we will be tough on subsidies in order to keep bills down for our families and businesses, and ensure value for money.”\nThe cost of energy has long been a source of friction between providers and consumers, although some retail bills have been cut by suppliers over the past 12 months, albeit on the back of lower wholesale commodity prices.\nSSE, one of the big six energy companies, was criticised after it announced on Wednesday that it had kept annual retail profits steady at £455m, despite losing 370,000 customers to lower-cost competitors.\nNational Grid, which operates pipes and pylons in England and Wales, reported on Thursday that pre-tax profits were up by 15% to £3bn in the year to March. Last autumn, energy regulator Ofgem said the average dual fuel domestic bill was £1,345.\nWhile Labour MPs have generally supported the green subsidies needed to support the development of solar and wind farms, the capacity market has been heavily criticised.\nLisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said the scheme to encourage energy companies to keep their power plants online to meet periods of peak demand was a “massive waste of money”. This was because previous payments had ended up going to nuclear facilities and other plants that would have stayed open regardless, or funded carbon-heavy diesel generators, she said.",

        "conteudo": "Shareholders of Allergan, a California-based pharmaceutical company, likely rejoiced when the company won the top spot in the Newsweek Green Rankings of the 500 largest publicly traded US companies last month. Newsweek and its partner, Corporate Knights Capital, cited the company's 20-year-old environmental strategy, with recent efforts focused on innovative waste management initiatives and energy-efficiency projects.\nGreen bloggers, on the other hand, saw the Allergan win as a sign that the list, which has been closely watched since its inception in 2009, might no longer be relevant to those truly interested in pursuing sustainability. The reason? Allergan is the maker of Botox, the cosmetic form of botulinum toxin, among other cosmetic products, such as Latisse, an eyelash-enhancement solution, and Natrelle-brand silicone breast implants.\nEnergy efficiency is all well and good, but what does sustainability mean when America's greenest company is built on pushing arguably dangerous ideals of female beauty?\nOther purportedly green rankings seem equally backward. For instance, it seems dubious to include Apple in the EPA Green Power Partnership's 2014 Top 30 Tech and Power List of the largest green power users when labor-rights organizations have roundly criticized the company for excessive overtime and harsh labor conditions in its Foxconn Technology Group facilities. It's difficult to applaud a business that lowers carbon-dioxide emissions while simultaneously exploiting its most vulnerable workers.\nDefining sustainability\nThe trouble seems to be that, while everybody loves a good top-10 list, rankings often fail to include social metrics that provide a more complete picture of a company's societal impact. Perhaps social metrics are overlooked because they're so much more difficult to objectively quantify than environmental metrics.\nSimon MacMahon, global director of advisory services at Sustainalytics, says that many commissioning organizations fail to put in the time and energy necessary to produce informed results: “To be credible, rankings need a strong methodology, a tested research process that in most cases should include company dialogue, and a team of skilled analysts. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts and so, the number of credible sustainability rankings out there is fairly limited.”\nRegardless of whether green rankings serve as a useful indicator of genuine progress, it’s clear that most disagreements over green rankings rest with the nebulous concept of sustainability. MacMahon notes that corporate sustainability (as opposed to governmental or personal sustainability) means different things to different companies and to different stakeholder groups. “There really is no one definition,” he says.\nIn a PV magazine article last year, Roger Ballentine, president of Green Strategies, an environmental and energy consulting firm, warned against confusing sustainability – which also includes transparency, corporate governance and social responsibility issues – with environmental friendliness. “Sustainability is a business metric,” he told Guardian Sustainable Business editor Jennifer Kho. “It’s like comparing price-to-earnings ratios; we’re evolving to a standard set of sustainability metrics.”\nBallentine added that if sustainability is going to be a universally applicable business metric, all companies should be judged in the same way. “We should be very consistent in how we evaluate companies in terms of sustainability metrics, regardless of what industry they’re in,” he told PV magazine.\nWhat really matters\nCarol Hee, who directs the Center for Sustainable Enterprise at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill University, says that if we define sustainability as the “triple bottom line” – measuring business performance in terms of its effects on people, the planet and profit – this provides corporate executives and stakeholders with a comprehensive lens through which to assess sustainability.\nTo determine whether a company is authentically sustainable, Hee seeks information on the management team, the firm’s corporate governance and the culture. “I’d also want to know whether the firm was socially responsible,” she said. “How does the firm treat its employees, retirees and job applicants? Does the firm have non-discriminatory practices, pay a fair wage, offer safe working conditions and benefits like health care and paid time off?”\nHee argues that social responsibility stretches beyond a company’s walls, extending to its interactions with overseas workers and the local community. For example, Apple and Nike, which have both topped various green rankings in the past few years, have grappled with bringing social concerns in line with environmental initiatives. After China Labor Watch found “labor camp” conditions at Apple's Foxconn assembly facility in Chengdu, China, in 2011, the company switched assembly to Pegatron, another Chinese facility, where China Labor Watch found new claims of exploitation in 2013. That didn't stop Apple from making the EPA's list of “greenest” tech companies that year. In 2012, Catholic NGO Education for Justice found a major Nike shoe factory was forcing employees to work unpaid overtime without benefits and was subjecting them to verbal abuse from supervisors. That same year, Nike took the top slot in the Climate Counts emissions reduction rankings.\nThe final component for corporate sustainability, in Hee’s view, is what the company is doing to minimize negative impacts over its product's entire life cycle, including raw materials acquisition, materials manufacturing, product manufacturing and packaging, transportation, retail, consumer use and waste.\nNewsweek's Green Rankings prompted the inevitable question as to whether such lists might ultimately do more harm than good. Done poorly, they can contribute to the general greenwashing of industry, encouraging companies to shoot for bogus metrics that distract from real corporate responsibility. Done well, they have the potential to lend a competitive justification for socially responsible initiatives. We'll have a better idea next year as to which is winning out.\nDebbi McCullough is an independent writer, editor and owner of Hanging Rock Media in Cary, North Carolina.\nThe social impact hub is funded by AngloAmerican.

        "conteudo": "The unlikely combination of Pharrell Williams and Al Gore have announced what they hope to be the largest global campaign in history, in the form of a second round of Live Earth concerts to promote awareness of climate change. The concerts will take place across all seven continents – including Antarctica – on 18 June.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the pair were joined by producer Kevin Wall to unveil an event aiming for a global television audience of 2 billion across 193 television networks.\nWilliams, who is the event’s creative director, did not reveal any details of who would be performing at the stadium shows, saying he was keeping surprises in store, but said: “Instead of just having people perform, we literally are going to have humanity harmonise all at once.”\nWilliams recalled playing Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro in 2007, describing it as “a ball”. However, he said, “You would have pundits and comedians who didn’t understand global warming and we were often ridiculed. We wanted to do something very different this time.” Williams’s commitment to raising awareness of climate change is longstanding. When he collaborated with Madonna on the 2007 single Hey You, 25 cents from each of the first million downloads was donated to the Alliance for Climate Protection.\nA promotional clip shown before Williams spoke offered a caption promising 100 artists in the seven shows. Each event will last from four to six hours.\nWall said: “The power of music is unique, because it’s borderless, without language, Pharrell will use that power. When you combine music with a message, you can effect change.”\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe European leg of the event will take place in Paris, ahead of the 2015 UN climate change conference in the French capital, scheduled for December. The organisers say that 1o2 broadcasters have so far signed up to carry the event.\nAt the first Live Earth event – also organised by Gore and Wall – on 7 July 2007, more than 150 acts performed in 11 locations around the world. The concerts were used as the launchpad for a seven-point pledge that invited attendees:\nTo demand that my country join an international treaty within the following two years that cuts global warming pollution by 90% in developed countries and by more than half worldwide in time for the next generation to inherit a healthy Earth;\nTo take personal action to help solve the climate crisis by reducing my own CO2 pollution as much as I can and offsetting the rest to become ‘carbon neutral’;\nTo fight for a moratorium on the construction of any new generating facility that burns coal without the capacity to safely trap and store the CO2;\nTo work for a dramatic increase in the energy efficiency of my home, workplace, school, place of worship, and means of transportation;\nTo fight for laws and policies that expand the use of renewable energy sources and reduce dependence on oil and coal;\nTo plant new trees and to join with others in preserving and protecting forests; and,\nTo buy from businesses and support leaders who share my commitment to solving the climate crisis and building a sustainable, just, and prosperous world for the 21st century.\nThe concerts were broadcast to more than 130 countries. Though the coverage was watched by 19 million people in the US, and won a then-record online audience of more than 8 million viewers, the event was not a ratings success in the UK, with a peak audience of about 4.5 million. That was attributed to a combination of good weather, live Wimbledon coverage, and the fact that it came just six days after the Concert for Diana, which had attracted a TV audience three times larger.\nThe Guardian’s Alexis Petridis was lukewarm about the London concert, writing: “There are moments of total bafflement: even with the lyrics changed to reference climate change, there’s a certain majestic inappropriateness about David Gray and Damien Rice singing Que Sera Sera. What there isn’t is any real emotional heft, or urgency, or sense of event.”\nAmong the acts who appeared at the 2007 concerts were: Genesis, the Black Eyed Peas, Metallica, the Beastie Boys (all London), Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Bon Jovi, the Police (all New York), Angélique Kidjo, Baaba Maal (both Johannesburg), Linkin Park, Rihanna (both Tokyo), Snoop Dogg and MIA (both Hamburg).",

Read the Guardian’s extensive coverage of the report, including:\n• Climate change report: 'The worst is yet to come' – as it happened\n• Climate change report: five key points\n• Climate change: the poor will suffer most\n• Climate change ‘already affecting food supply’ - UN\nWe've collected reactions from business leaders, thought leaders and experts here.\nChristine Bader, author of The Evolution of a Corporate Idealist: When Girl Meets Oil\nMost companies have people deep inside their ranks who have known for a long time what the IPCC report confirms: that the threat of climate change is serious and imminent, and presents risks not just to ecosystems but to business. The IPCC report should create more space for those people in companies to push forward the policies and programs that will mitigate risks to both their bottom line and to individuals and communities around the world.\nKara Hurst, CEO of The Sustainability Consortium\nThe IPCC report is a wake up call on several levels, not the least of which are the true ramifications of what some have seen as more of an abstract issue to date. Shining a bright light on the human costs: security, food and poverty in particular, the IPCC has connected environmental and social issues in a real and inextricable way. These are not \"environmental\" or \"social\" issues, but human ones.\nThis is an important moment in time for businesses to heed the call to work with governments and policy makers to look at how climate change affects not only the access to natural capital for the products and services they produce but, equally, their relationships with communities, workers, and people globally.\nKathrin Winkler, senior vice-president and chief sustainability officer of EMC Corp\nThe IPCC report reinforces what we already know from looking all around us – that climate change is having an impact on people’s lives today, and that the impacts to come will be broad and substantial. Companies that will thrive in the future are those that recognize and respond to climate change as an expanding driver of both risk and opportunity; that introduce new innovations both to reduce and adapt to the coming changes in ways that protect and enhance quality of life globally.\nPeter Graf, chief sustainability officer and executive vice president at SAP:\nFor the most impact, companies need to find ways to minimize carbon emissions that are integral to how they create value. For example, consumer goods companies would look at their extended supply chain. Or software companies would look at the environmental impact of their data centers.\nJonah Sachs, CEO of Free Range Studios and author of Winning the Story Wars: Why Those Who Tell (and Live) the Best Stories Will Rule the Future\nThe IPCC report drives home the severity and risks of climate change with undeniable urgency. Climate change is an imminent man-made consequence threatening our water and food supply, culture, and our very survival. However, just as we have the ability to create such environmental damage, we also have the power to reverse it through public, government and business efforts.\nWe have the facts. Yet facts don’t spark change; stories do. This is the ideal opportunity for businesses to use storytelling to inspire collaborative action to fight climate change. In the midst of such dire need for environmental reform, brands have the ability to position themselves as innovators and thought leaders in their industries through the stories they share. By integrating sustainability into company identities and committing to a mission for a sustainable future, businesses can build loyal consumer communities.\nThe most effective businesses will connect green practices to the goods and services that their brands provide and share a captivating story that embodies these values. Through such authentic leadership, sustainable brands will grow and thrive, while simultaneously working to build a better future.\nAnthony Hobley, CEO of Carbon Tracker\nThe IPPC WGII report highlights that climate change and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will result in serious physical impacts to human beings and our ability to carry on business. An unstable climate will detrimentally impact ecosystems, water and the food security we all depend upon.\nCarbon Tracker has focused on the issue of the un-burnable carbon, the resulting carbon budget and the risk of stranded assets in the fossil fuel sector. The un-burnable carbon thesis is based on simple maths. If burn more fossil fuels than the two degrees carbon budget then we will overshoot the two degrees target.\nThe IPCCs WGII report reveals the other side of the stranded assets coin, the physical stranded assets we shall face if we allow that to happen. We have done the numbers, the IPCC looked at the physics.\nThere are only three likely outcomes. In a first Goldilocks scenario, we will have a clear policy signal by 2015 that allows the orderly transition to a low carbon economy and a managed deflation of the carbon bubble. This keeps the risk of stranded assets, financial or physical to a minimum. Albeit, we will still need to adapt and become resilient to two degrees of warming. Still a major challenge.\nIn the second “nightmare” scenario, as Exxon [predicted], policymakers won’t do what they committed to do in order to maintain global warming below the two degrees level, the world will slide into four to six degrees of global warming. That would be catastrophic for business, investors and humanity. The poor would be impacted first, but ultimately we would all be detrimentally impacted. This is where we would see physical stranded assets on a massive scale, submerged cities, loss of agriculture and many investments would become worthless in such a world.\nThe third, scenario, based on human behavior when faced with a growing crisis, is the last minute scenario, where, we leave action to the last possible minute, governments panic when faced with a impending climate tipping point and regulate aggressively over night. In this scenario we see the highest risk of stranded assets in the fossil fuel sector.\nClearly there is no free lunch here. The best we can do is act sooner rather than later to minimise the risk, cost and impacts.\nAnne L Kelly, director of Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy (Bicep) and policy at Ceres\nThe report comprehensively confirms what the truly leading businesses and investors already know; ie that the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of acting now. The Obama administration's commitment to regulate carbon as a pollutant is vital to mitigation efforts and to capturing the economic gold of a clean energy economy in the US and beyond.\nJonathan Rowson, director of the RSA's Social Brain Centre Zoe Knight, head of the Climate Change Centre of Excellence at HSBC\nThere are differential regional risks from climate change, but we think the report conclusions provide added impetus for policymakers to integrate robust adaptation plans into national development strategies – bedding in resilience to future disruption. The politics around maintaining industrial competitiveness has side-lined climate policy in some cases, now the WGII report provides a stark warning of the potential disruption in the future if policymakers get distracted from climate. The far reaching impacts of climate change affect the global economy in all regions, but particularly for the livelihoods of the poor. We believe the evidence presented by the IPCC provides impetus for policymakers to set out and implement national goals in the run-up to a 2015 global deal, and for business and investors to act in line with delivering a low-carbon economy.\nStefan Heck, co-author of Resource Revolution: How to Capture the Biggest Business Opportunity in a Century\nThe latest IPCC report re-emphasizes the increased resource risks businesses face from climate change, water and food shortages as ecosystems change, and minerals and energy price spikes as 2.5 billion additional consumers join the middle class. The risk is real - 5% to 70% of earnings are at stake depending on industry and its resource intensity. But increased risk is only half the story.\nWe are at the cusp of an unprecedented business opportunity to build on the experience of the industrial revolution that delivered a step change in labor and capital productivity and massive wealth and quality of life for developed countries. Businesses can deliver the same 10x increase in productivity in how we use resources. Hampton Creek Foods is creating mayonnaise from abundant soybeans instead of chicken eggs, reducing disease risk and decoupling itself from volatile corn as feedstock. Tesla, BMW and Mitsubishi have all launched electric vehicles that can drive the equivalent of $10 a gas tank, and Alcoa has driven aluminum recycling globally, saving 95% of the energy requires to mine and purify new aluminum.\nThis is a start, but the biggest shift is yet to come as we take large expensive fixed assets - planes, cars, buildings, highways - and get more use out of them using software optimization and sharing. By sharing cars, we go from assets that are parked most of the time (96%) to 60% utilization, a 15x increase. Planes and trucks can save 30% of the fuel by traveling in formations like geese, all of which drops directly to the bottom line as profits. Now that's a good climate for business!\nSedex\nFood price rises: @SedexCSR link to this article on food prices rising as a result of climate change:\n@CHedegaardEU\nWhile critics warn that the report is \"alarmist\", the EU commissioner for climate action, Connie Hedegaard, offers an alarm clock metaphor for people's behavior:\nClimate-KIC\nA blog from experts at Climate-KIC, the EU’s main climate innovation initiative, on why CEOs should consider the changing climate in strategic planning and decision-making.\nAnd Richard Templer, director at Climate-KIC UK, has told the Guardian:\nThe latest IPCC report tells me that emergency response to extreme weather events is no longer enough. Although we have to keep doing all we can to stop further climate change, now is the time to also prepare our homes, businesses and cities for the impact of irreversible change and boost the economy in the process.\nThe world needs to use climate science to anticipate where we will be vulnerable to extreme weather events and then design infrastructure and systems that will minimize the impacts of storms and droughts.\nContrary to what you often hear, some of the world’s best and brightest entrepreneurs and scientists are keen to enter the climate innovation sector. I see an unacknowledged hunger amongst people to do something positive about climate change. So yes, we are hovering on the brink of something very dangerous but there are a lot of very talented and entrepreneurial people out there that are working away at transforming the way society can face up to the challenges of climate change and make a positive difference – while our society reaps the economic benefits.\n@Passim_Blog\nMap of human, biological and environmental impacts of the IPCC's findings – but in which countries will business be most affected?\nBBC video on the IPCC The Economist\nA worthwhile read from the Economist on the subtler affects of climate change – the question of 'how much might all these influences affect the world economy?' might be of particular interest.",

        "conteudo": "Guardian sustainable business\nDavos 2014: business and sustainability – day two as it happened\nAll of Thursday's action on business, climate change, sustainability and resources. Look out for our coverage throughout the day on:\nWater and the post-2015 development agenda\nRegulatory frameworks for climate change\nThe latest climate science on the melting arctic\nUpdated\nThe 2030 Water Resources Group are meeting in Davos today to discuss the importance of water for the post-2015 development agenda. Photograph: Torin Halsey/AP\nThursday 23 January 2014 15.00 EST\nLast modified on Tuesday 3 June 2014 00.21 EDT\n14:56\nNew millennial consumers and sustainability\nDara O’Rourke, a professor at UC Berkeley and the co-founder of GoodGuide.com , is the chair of WEF's Global Agenda Council on Sustainable Consumption. On the quandary of how brands and retailers should engage with new consumers, O'Rourke writes:\nThe next generation of consumers is clearly on the minds of the CEOs and CMOs at Davos. A number of sessions have touched on what emerging “millennial” consumers of China, India, Brazil, and beyond will look like in 10 years. And similarly, how the next generation of consumers in the US and Europe will act.\nEveryone seems to agree that new technologies, and in particular emerging mobile, wearable, ubiquitous, transparent information systems, are radically changing how new millennials see and interact with products, brands, and retailers, what they demand of them, and what they want for their futures. Consumers can know more, and they obviously share much more than ever before. The pace of this change is only accelerating.\nHowever, brands and retailers are frustrated that their efforts to engage consumers around sustainability have had limited impact to date. Increasingly, they admit in closed-door sessions, that they simply don’t know how to talk to the new millennials.\nThese new consumers, in fact, bristle at even being called consumers. They think of themselves as makers, users, sharers, and sometimes participants in the production of products, services, content, etc. They have values. They get status from different things than their parents did. And they want to support products and companies that align with their values.\nBut as one CEO lamented: are young consumers really disruptive enough? Do they care about labor and environment issues? Will they change their demand for cheap fast fashion when they learn about tragedies like in Bangladesh? Or do they just want new sexy products at low prices?\nThese questions have bottom line impacts as CEOs assess how to redesign products and business models to meet new demands. And they clearly have implications for global sustainability. Will these new millennials consume as Northern consumers have? Or might they embrace sharing (rather than owning) and the circular economy? Will they even have jobs to pay for the goods and services these companies sell.\nThere is clearly significant potential to engage these new millennials, and in particular to support their participation in efforts to rethink products and business to promote sustainability.\nThe good news on this is that some of the largest retailers and brands in the world are studying these issues and beginning to develop programs to try to engage the next generation of consumers/makers/citizens.\n11:26\nDanish environment minister on why the circular economy is the future\nWe caught up with Ida Auken, the Danish environment minister who believes the circular economy offers one of the best routes to sustainable business transformation. This is what she had to say:\nWhether you are a political leader looking for a new vision on where to go coming out of the crisis, or a business leader looking for new business opportunities, then look no further than the circular economy.\nIf you are a green NGO still discussing with your organisation whether business is part of the solution or only part of the problem, then look in the same direction.\nIt is going to be huge and transform the way we think, produce, consume and live. Everything needs to be redesigned when we move from a linear to a circular economy, so that we make sure that we don’t lose or destroy our natural resources but instead make products and services that are resource efficient, recyclable and innovative.\nThis will include new leasing and sharing models and creative ways for businesses to engage with their customers. The good news is you will not be alone. Here in Davos I have met business leaders from some of the world’s largest companies wanting to drive this agenda and transform their own business models.\nI have met large consulting firms that want to help you do it the right way and I have met people from the start up world that have ideas if someone is willing to invest in it. To quote one of the champions of the circular economy – just do it!\nIda Auken, the Danish environment minister. Photograph: Claus Bjørn Larsen\nUpdated\n08:10\nProof that cross sector collaborations can drive change\nThere has been some time to reflect on discussions at this morning's 2030 Water Resources Group meeting. Jo Confino has this:\nCountries struggling with water scarcity are flocking for help to an innovative cross-sector organisation that is proving that collaboration in sustainability really can drive change.\nThe 2030 Water Resources Group (WRG) is currently working with eight countries but several others have approached the group in recent months, including Bangladesh, Kenya, Lebanon, Colombia, Panama and Lebanon.\nThe WRG seeks to mobilise stakeholders from the public and private sector, civil society, academia and financing institutions to engage in fact-based, analytical approaches and coalition building.\nAnders Berntell, executive director of the WRG, says one of the biggest impacts it can have is to break down the silos among government ministries, given that the responsibility for water is often shared between several departments, including health, economy and mining.”\nBreaking down silos between government ministries was on the agenda at this morning's 2030 Water Resources Group meeting. Photograph: Alamy\nUpdated\n08:03\nWorld Bank’s head of climate change says WEF’s elite structure excludes women\nRachel Kyte, group vice president and special envoy for climate change at the World Bank, has written us this reflection on her experience so far at Davos.\nInteresting discussions here on the gender factor. The focus of debate in the media has been on the decreasing participation rate of women in Davos (only 15% this year, down from the high of 17% last year).\nOf course, all the evidence is that diversity leads to smarter risk taking, better team performance and more effective business strategies and so discussing plans for people and the planet without this diversity could be seen to be self defeating.\nBut is there a cause and effect dimension as well? WEF at Davos has perfected the illusion of exclusivity. Its structure is like a Russian doll - elites, within elites, within elites. Is there something about this structure which is less attractive to women leaders than men? Would more women leaders come (aside from needing more women in leadership positions) if the organisational values were flatter. After all how can we discuss inclusive economies from this vantage point?”\nIf you'd like more on diversity at Davos, you can explore the numbers in more depth over on the data blog and on the Women in Leadership section, where Lynda Gratton writes that whilst it would marvellous to see equal numbers of men and women at Davos, she isn't holding her breath.\n07:20\nWhy 2014 needs to be the year of effective partnerships\nTime for a quick breather and to take stock of the mood coming out of the sustainable business sessions.\nMy colleague Jo Confino writes:\nSpeaking to business leaders in Davos, there is a recognition we need a seismic shift in the sustainability movement if progressive companies have any chance of taking on the fossil fuel lobby.\nCEOs and business organisations also understand that they need to get their act together in order to present a unified front at the upcoming UN climate summit in September and then through to the global climate negotiations in France in 2015.\nIndividual companies and progressive business associations have worried for some time that they are no match for the fossil fuel lobby, which is far better organised and financed.\nThey have also failed so far to have any impact on the largest traditional business councils, such as Business Europe, which appear to remain hell bent on fighting environmental legislation, which they view as an unnecessary additional regulatory burden.\nOne leader told me: “Realising business leadership will be pivotal in building momentum for a strong global climate framework by 2015.\n“We need to change the narrative around climate change and engage in dialogue with policy makers. It is vital we give political leaders the confidence to act.”\nWEF has been calling for the creation of new coalitions and points to “increasing recognition that governments can benefit from wider support” in the task of addressing climate change.\nIt says: “By drawing on the combined innovation, resources and effort from across the public, private and civil society sectors and through mobilising large-scale, practical collaboration and alliances, significant new opportunities to lower emissions and build economic resilience can be realised.”\nIt points out that climate change and related impacts such as extreme weather events, food crisis and water scarcity represent four of the top 10 global economic risks identified by its updated global risk report.\n06:58\nClimate change agenda\nThis year, climate change is firmly on the agenda at Davos, which will have a record 23 sessions dedicated to the subject.\n— Christiana Figueres (@CFigueres) January 23, 2014\nTomorrow: Climate Day @ #wef14 . @un #SecGen to address Changing the Climate for Growth and Development @davos http://t.co/mzDbROruPc\nJamie Henn, strategy director for international climate campaign organisation 350.org , is urging political and corporate participants to use the World Economic Forum as a chance to move beyond the business-as-usual narrative and address climate change as a systemic, urgent threat:\n﻿I think 2014 is the year that the discussion about a carbon bubble will go mainstream. The fossil fuel divestment movement is spreading like wildfire at universities and in cities around the world. The financial community cannot continue to ignore its role in fuelling the climate crisis. Governments, businesses, and a civil society have all come under pressure to take steps to address climate change.\nUp until now, the financial community has largely been left off the hook. That needs to change. In order to move forward and lay the groundwork for strong climate action in the lead up to the 2015 international climate negotiations, attendees at the WEF need to discuss divestment from the fossil fuel industry and investing instead in the renewable sector. Investing in emerging clean energy sectors, which are part of the necessary climate solution, represents a huge opportunity for asset managers.\nUpdated\n05:33\nMongolian president injects spirit into Davos talks\nThe president of Mongolia today gave a much needed spiritual dimension to the talks at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nSpeaking about the water shortages affecting his country, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj said: “My mother told me that water means life, and in reality water is the mother of all living.\n“If water is polluted and threatened, it means your mother is in danger. We have to save our global mother.”\nElbegdorj also said the private sector can be more effective in coming up with solutions to the water crisis than governments.\n“I believe private companies are smarter than any government,” he said.\nElbegdorj also called for the post-2015 global development agenda to have a single goal for water, as the issue had lost its focus, in part, because it had been split up between various Milennium Development Goals.\n“Decision makers are vey lazy people so let’s work together to create for them a unified global water act.”\nUpdated\n05:18\nTanzania's president on critical water scarcity facing East African nation\nTanzania’s President made a heartfelt speech about the impacts of the critical water shortages affecting the East African nation and called on international development agencies to take the issue more seriously.\nJakaya Kikwete said the development focus tended to be on areas such as education and health and there was little understanding that access to water was critical also for these sectors, as well as economic growth.\n“Water is not considered a priority – if you talk about health, in Africa many diseases are water borne. Clean water is part of health,” said Kikwete.\nHe also spoke of how climate change was deeply affecting Tanzania, as well as other East African countries.\n“When I was growing up, there were many rivers and during the rainy season many people were washed away,” he said. “These days those rivers are running dry. Those that were permanent have become seasonal and even during the rainy seasons there is not enough water.\n“We are dependent on hydro power generation but in the last decade, it has become very unreliable as dams do not have enough water.\n“Our lakes are declining. Lake Victoria has fallen by a metre and one lake has receded by seven kilometers. Cross-border issues are also growing; people are fighting over meagre resources of water.\n“Droughts have become more frequent, and for a longer period of time. When we hear about floods in Europe and elsewhere, we think can we have at least one experience of floods.”\nUpdated\n02:57\nGood morning from the Guardian Sustainable Business team reporting from the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nOver the next three days we'll bring you as many updates as possible from all of the climate change, resource security and sustainability sessions in Davos.\nJo Confino and I only made our way up the mountain late last night. So to kick us off this morning we have a brief summary of yesterday's events from Jon Alexander, director of the New Citizenship Project.\nThe headline tone of Davos seems to be a cautious good news message on the economy, and something of a return to pre-2008 spirits, tempered with a healthy if slightly superficial respect for the Pope's opening incitement to \"ensure that humanity is served by wealth, not ruled by it.\nDigging into the sessions, though, there's a real sense of uncertainty emerging, a sense that perhaps deeper systemic questions can and must be asked, not just a return to business as usual but with a moral veneer.\nThis first came through in an opening session on 'doing business the right way' with a real mixture of stories as to what this means.\nOne or two of the CEOs on the panel seemed to feel that business is very much on the right track, but that a few bad apples need to be called out. But the centre of gravity in the conversation was very much in the space of business guru Michael Porter's 'shared value', calling for broader, longer term thinking about profit and stakeholder not just shareholder return.\nThere was even a hint from PWC International Chairman Dennis Nally that purpose rather than profit might become the key vector for business. As he put it, \"There will always be conflicts, and without a clear idea of purpose, it will be profit that makes the decisions.\"\nAs the day continued, the sense that there really are no clear and confidently held solutions kept coming back. Whether it was Harvard professor Jonathan Zittrain closing his big data talk by joking that we should regroup in 20 years to laugh at the inadequacy of our attempts even to conceptualise the challenges, Al Gore discussing the latest climate science, or a panel including Tim Berners-Lee and the Pope's representative Archbishop Turkson, struggling to understand the emerging global morals and norms.\nUpdated",

        "conteudo": "The 98 square kilometres of the Cappadocia region in Turkey make for a strange landscape. Powdery white soil gives the place a lunar feel. The hollowed out hillsides and 10-metre tall “fairy chimneys”, a tourist attraction crafted by wind and rain, could be leftovers from a 1970s James Bond set. At night, lights flicker in the cones of rock, which hundreds of people call home.\nBeneath the earth, however, things look even stranger: a network of caves, connected into what used to be entire subterranean cities. Derinkuyu, in southern Cappadocia, was once home to as many as 20,000 residents living together underground. There's a huge bathhouse, complete with a set of private rooms and tall ceilings to allow steam to rise, all of it ventilated by a system of shafts that run for dozens of kilometres in every direction – sometimes a vast distance from the populated areas to trick potential invaders.\nLong abandoned, the underground cities of Cappadocia have rather suddenly been rediscovered: by the produce industry. The constant underground temperature of about 13C make the caves an ideal storage climate for thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables: apples, cabbage and cauliflower stay fresh for up to four weeks; citrus fruits, pears and potatoes for months. In a cave near the village of Ortahisar, nearly 6m crates of lemons sit in endless stacks. They arrive from Turkey’s Mediterranean coast on trucks and are unloaded by hand. Labourers – mostly women – package and stack the fruit, which then is stored underground until it is needed for export to Europe, Russia and elsewhere.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPotatoes stored in the Cappadocia caves can stay fresh for many months. Photograph: Ali Kabas/Alamy\nOkan Yazgan, who runs the Aravan Evi hotel here, has taken advantage. “We have a cave store with a capacity of 100 tonnes, but we do not have a large enough area for growing potatoes. So we rent our store space,” he said. The potatoes are stored underground and sold in situ when prices increase during winter and spring, Yazgan added.\nThe volcanic rock of these underground cities is moist and soft to the touch – a car key or pen easily leaves a mark – and the walls carry the marks of its former residents. Small ridges can be seen on the walls and ceilings, made as long as 3,500 years ago by the first people to realise that they could chisel out a home here. They liked living underground for much of the same reason that the produce vendors do: when visiting Cappadocia in 400 BC, Xenophon, a student of Socrates, reported seeing goats, sheep, cows and poultry fed on straw and hay. “Corn, rice, vegetables and barley beer was stored in large pots,” he wrote.\nCould other cities learn from Cappadocia's example? Berlin is home to many kilometres of underground tunnels and rooms, built in the second world war to protect against bombings; Switzerland has enough underground space to shelter every citizen in the event of nuclear war. Singapore, meanwhile, is planning to use a 150-acre cavern under the city to store fuel and build a facility for scientists and researchers. Although cities that don't already have underground space would likely see limited benefits – meat and frozen foods certainly would require the refrigeration only fridges and supermarkets freezers provide – Nikolai Bobylev, an environmental scientist at Saint Petersburg State University, says underground urban space is an overlooked resource.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nGoreme in the Cappacdocia region has been the site of an underground city for centuries. Photograph: Dan Wiklund/Getty\n“We can use underground space for all the urban services that do not require daylight – transport, waste management, retail,” he says. “Thus we can save pressure [on] above-ground space for living, recreation, greenery – creating compact and more sustainable cities.”\nIn Cappadocia, some of the underground warehouses have a capacity of 20,000 tonnes, but the financial incentive is proving irresistible: local companies and those in the produce business have begun carving out new caves in the rock, and international companies such as Frito Lay are reported to be planning to invest.\nThousands of years since they were first created, the underground cities of Cappadocia are growing once again.\n• Russia’s dreary suburbs make for creative hotspots",

We remain firmly opposed to it and continue to strongly promote a transition to an energy system based on energy efficiency and our abundant resource of renewable energy, which is getting cheaper to exploit by the day.\n“We have always been an evidence-based organisation and we commission independent reports to ensure our policy positions are robust, and we will continue to do so in the future.\nCraig Bennett, the group’s director of policy and campaigns, and the spokesman whose comments the BBC had based its report on, said the BBC’s news reporting had been “misleading” and asked the broadcaster to make a correction.\nBennett had appeared on a package on energy security earlier in the Today programme, and was asked by journalist Justin Rowlatt whether Friends of the Earth was no longer worried about the risk from radiation.\nBennett said: “Of course there are real concerns about radiation particularly around nuclear waste and it’s right we are concerned about that. But it’s important the debate has shifted down the years – the real concern now is how we get on fast with decarbonising our electricity supply, if you look at the models, it shows nuclear cannot be delivered fast.”\nHarrabin defended the BBC’s reporting, writing on Twitter: “Does FoE want existing nukes closed? No. Is its main objection now cost not safety? Yes. You’re not pro-nuke but this is shift.”\nTweets from the official Friends of the Earth account responded that there was no shift in position: “Safety including waste still big intractable issue, new evidence on cost makes arguments against even stronger.”\nSeveral high profile environmental commentators who were previously opposed to nuclear power, including Guardian columnist George Monbiot and author Mark Lynas, have changed their position in recent years and given their backing to nuclear power as a low carbon source of energy because of the urgency of tackling climate change.",

FoE said he was too focused on propping up oil companies at the expense of making renewable energy cheaper.\nDavid Powell, economics campaigner at FoE, said: \"The chancellor falls over himself to claim renewable energy is expensive, while bending over backwards to offer oil barons massive tax breaks.\n\"Reducing the tax bill for rich oil companies will either bolster their already fat profits, or cause more climate changing fossil fuels to be extracted that would have been left in the ground, or both.\"\nFoE said field allowances that were first introduced in 2009 by Alistair Darling have been significantly expanded by Osborne.\nWith huge subsidies planned to encourage fracking and further cuts to subsidies for wind farms and solar energy on the horizon, Osborne has come under intense pressure from environmental groups to change course.\nFoE has calculated that if taken up in full, 32 new or existing North Sea oil and gas fields qualified for allowances awarded in 2013-14 worth a total of £2.7bn to the industry over five years. The £2.7bn is how much tax companies would otherwise have had to pay on their profits from oil and gas extraction. In 2012-13, 28 fields received tax breaks totalling £1.95bn, FoE said.\nA spokeswoman for the Treasury said the government remained on course to meet the target of 15% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2020.",

        "conteudo": "A “compromise” renewable energy policy being promoted by crossbench senators would result in windfall gains worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year for existing hydro-electric companies while stifling any new investment in renewables such as wind farms, according to analysts.\nThe plan has been developed by the Liberal Democrat senator, David Leyonhjelm, and has been included in a letter to Tony Abbott that is being circulated to crossbench senators for signature. It is understood to have the support of senators Bob Day, John Madigan and Jacqui Lambie.\nThe letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, said: “We, the undersigned, being cross-bench senators set out herein a proposal to modify and improve federal renewable energy policy.”\nIt outlined a plan that would recognise hydro-generation built before 1998 under the requirements of the renewable energy target (RET) and therefore “avoid the need to install more than 25,000 gigawatt hours of new large scale (renewable) capacity”.\nIt pointed out that ongoing uncertainty surrounding the RET had caused new investment to stop. It argued that if this continued and electricity retailers had no access to the renewable energy they were legally required to buy under the RET legislation, they would have to pay a “penalty charge”. It proposed the inclusion of pre-existing hydro as the best solution.\nThe executive director of the Australia Institute, Richard Denniss, called the scheme a “stinker” and said that if Leyonhjelm had “set out to design a scheme with the objective of undermining the RET and increasing electricity prices, it is difficult to think of a more effective way of doing it”.\n“While electricity consumers are the biggest losers from this proposal, the biggest winners are the owners of the existing hydro generators. The vast majority of these are state governments, so it effectively becomes a state government tax on electricity users.”\nKane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said the plan “would deliver a massive payout to existing hydro power generation, while squeezing out newer types of renewable energy”.\n“This proposal would represent a wealth transfer of some $906m per annum, or $13.5bn between now and 2030, paid to existing hydro power at the expense of $14.5bn of investment in new, large-scale renewable energy,” he said.\nBecause the scheme would not encourage new investment it would also not meet the objectives of the RET to encourage new investment and additional reductions in greenhouse emissions, but would impose the same costs on consumers.\nGovernment sources said they had not seen the plan, but it is understood the government is planning a special briefing for senators on the details of the RET’s operations.\nGuardian Australia revealed on Monday that Leyonhjelm was counting crossbench votes for some kind of compromise after newly independent Jacqui Lambie indicated she could vote for changes to the RET if the government made concessions over defence force pay.\nA loose “coalition of common sense” comprising independent and minor party senators has a range of different concerns about the existing RET – which requires 41,000 gigawatt hours of electricity to be sourced from renewables by 2020.\nThe government wanted to reduce this to about 26,000 gigawatt hours but has failed to convince Labor and the Palmer United party (PUP) to back changes. Labor walked out of talks on the issue earlier this month.\nPUP senators have vowed to block any change to the RET this term, but Lambie, who formally quit the party on Monday, has advocated including existing Tasmanian hydro projects in the RET. She said the RET was threatening 10,000 Tasmanian jobs.\nShe has also said she would vote against all government legislation until the prime minister agreed to increase the recent below-inflation defence force pay offer. The prime minister’s office has said Abbott might meet the newly independent senator in coming days.\n“I am working on an alternative crossbench proposal … it is nowhere near final but it would solve some of the problems we are facing … including the problem of hitting the penalty price,” Leyonhjelm told Guardian Australia. “I have a plan on the table and I’m trying to get the crossbench numbers on that now.”\nLeyonhjelm and Day support a reduction in the RET. Day told Guardian Australia he strongly supported Lambie’s call for the inclusion of existing hydro in the scheme.\nIndependent senator Madigan has supported a reduction in the RET and both he and the South Australian senator Nick Xenophon have argued it has allowed for too much investment in wind power at the expense of other kinds of renewables such as geothermal.\nThis could leave the Motoring Enthusiast senator, Ricky Muir, with the deciding vote on the issue.\nHe recently recommitted to voting alongside PUP senators to oppose any changes to the scheme, but he is being heavily lobbied by all sides.\nLambie also indicated she would be open to discussions with the government about its so-far thwarted plan to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, but that has also been opposed by the two remaining PUP senators, as well as Muir and Xenophon.\n“We’re having great difficulties down in Tasmania. There’s 10,000 direct and indirect jobs on the line here over the RET and the clean finance situation that we’re in, so I just want to get to the bottom of it. I’d like to see also with Tasmania that the hydro … is counted … it’s 100% renewable energy down in Tasmania and basically we’ve been getting the worst end when it comes to the RET,” Lambie said in a speech to parliament as she resigned from the PUP on Monday.\n“I am now free to negotiate with the government and other members of this parliament in good faith and for the best interests of my Tasmania, for reform of the following matters: the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the renewable energy target.”\nIn a speech to the senate late on Tuesday, Lambie again demanded that Tasmania be entirely exempted from the RET because of its reliance on cheap electricity. “They have taken away our single best economic advantage – cheap electricity!\n“Labor and Liberal’s RET policies have placed a boot on the throat of Tasmanian\nindustry and workers – and I want it removed immediately.”\nAs revealed by Guardian Australia, the same group of senators also moved to establish yet another inquiry into the alleged effects of wind farms on power prices, human health and wildlife.",

        "conteudo": "Stop investing in dirty fossil fuels and rapidly shift to renewable energy to prevent dangerous climate change – this was the message from Sunday's long-awaited UN report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nWhy, then, is the government still kowtowing to big energy companies determined to keep us hooked on dirty energy? Last week I travelled to the south-west of England to meet people taking matters into their own hands.\nWadebridge Renewable Energy Network (Wren) in Cornwall and Plymouth Energy Community in Devon are two exciting co-operatives rolling out clean energy in their local areas.\nFor Stephen Frankel, chair of Wren and professor of epidemiology, the big energy shakeup isn't happening fast enough. Energy policy is fundamentally confused, he says. Politicians talk of decarbonising and decentralising our energy system, but the six large utility firms still have a stranglehold over energy policy – and all the money. Three years ago he was sitting at a pub table saying something had to be done, to take people back to the future, and give them control over their energy again. So off he went and did it.\nAt their energy shop on the high street, Jerry Clark, technical director, explained to me how Wren works. We're a one-stop shop for energy, he said. You may not be motivated by climate change, but if you want to know how to save money on your energy bills, come on in and we'll tell you your options. Wren then acts as a broker – finding installers to fit free insulation, solar panels and so on – and the customer pays a small finder's fee.\nAnd what a success it has been. Already Wren has over 1,000 members in Wadebridge and the surrounding area, and has procured more than 200 installations. There are solar panels on the laundrette and the wine shop now, and also on a local school that we visited – they're saving it at least £5,000 annually.\nWhat's fascinating is that Wren even has its own currency, a beautifully decorated note given out like reward vouchers for a supermarket. It's accepted by independent shops in Wadebridge, keeping money in the town. The installers are local, and Wren also donates to the food bank and other nearby community projects. They say there's about £1m in the local economy that wouldn't be there otherwise – now that's something.\nIt is a little strange to think, though, that Wren's success relies on its customers finding their energy options so difficult to decipher – from the green deal to the renewable heat incentive. It's great that they trust Wren to make sense of it all, but does the government really need to make things so complicated?\nSolar power panels at St Breock primary school, Wadebridge, Cornwall. Left to right: Kevin Smith (Wren), Andy Atkins (Friends of the Earth) and Jerry Clark (Wren). Photograph: Friends of the Earth Wren/Friends of the Earth\nWren is also working to provide local and cooperatively-owned energy at community scale, with the energy generated being used to power nearby homes at a reduced price. And it is pioneering aspects of a smart grid that can cope with fluctuations in generation from renewables.\nThey just need to overcome grid connection issues, Clark explained. The National Grid can be very slow to connect individual renewable energy installations and can charge a high amount for it, making the real cost to investors and communities far greater than that of the actual installation. It would have cost Wren over £1m to install solar on one particular Wadebridge school – crazy, isn't it?\nWadebridge is working hard to become energy self-sufficient. By the end of this year around 89% of the energy used locally will be produced locally. But only about 3% of the energy being produced right now is through installations owned by local people. Wren hopes to bring more of the current and new generation into local ownership, with a goal of 30% by 2016. I looked down at it from the hillside: a fairly typical market town of fewer than 10,000 people, not renowned for its green credentials like neighbouring Totnes. If Wadebridge could go renewable, so could other towns like it – Wren estimates that a third of the country has the right size population, roof space, and sufficient surrounding land.\nWith everything I'd seen and heard, we headed to Devon. In Plymouth, I met Dave Garland, a director of Plymouth Energy Community, and Alistair Macpherson, low-carbon city team leader at Plymouth city council. Their aim is to get solar panels onto at least 20 schools and community buildings in Plymouth over the next six months.\nPlymouth city council has provided half the funding needed via a £500,000 low-cost loan – and the rest is being crowd-funded through a community share offer. In just over five weeks they have raised £484,000 – with around 58% of investors living in Plymouth. This is an amazing success. Partly it's down to its marketing budget; partly the council's endorsement. But what I really like is how accessible it is to ordinary people. The minimum share is just £50 – and with a rate of return of 6% per year, far higher than an ISA, why wouldn't you?\nSchools can make huge annual savings through solar panels, with half-price clean electricity that could well cover library costs; as a former teacher, Garland holds the issue close to his heart. I couldn't agree more: it's why Friends of the Earth is launching its own new campaign to help schools nationwide go solar.\nBut there are technical and legal challenges to getting many energy projects off the ground. As Macpherson said, success comes with having three or four key individuals with lots of expertise and spare time. But many groups aren't this lucky, and that's when you need a council to step in, as has been the case in Plymouth.\nCertainly I think Macpherson is correct to say that local authorities should encourage community energy projects by providing funding, or at least permission and expertise. They are good long-term investments on behalf of local people, and a practical way for councils to demonstrate their commitment and leadership towards reducing carbon emissions. But we need help from central government too, starting first and foremost with greater ambition for community energy.\nThere's huge potential for community energy in the UK and it could play a major role in shifting us on to renewables. According to a report by the thinktank Respublica in September last year , community energy accounts for 46% of all energy produced from renewables in Germany, while in the UK this figure stands at just 0.3%. It's hard to see why the government is keeping it on the sidelines – unless it's worried about the threat to it poses to the big six energy companies and the fossil-fuel status quo.\nThe government must help people to start community energy projects, by making it easier to afford upfront costs.\nThe funding announced in the community energy strategy - will only go so far. In Germany people can get low-interest community energy loans from their bank. I want to see these available on every UK high street. And community-owned installations should be given priority for grid connection, at a low, affordable cost.\nThe winners of the global race to decarbonise will be the countries that invest now in solar power. Solar is already cheaper than gas in many parts of the world; it should be a no-brainer for any government serious about reducing energy bills and increasing energy security in a way that doesn't add to carbon emissions – unlike fracking.\nCommunity energy projects could go a long way towards providing solar in the UK, keeping down our energy bills, slashing carbon emissions, and boosting local economies. The government needs to act now to remove the barriers and empower ordinary people to launch a massive generation of new, clean energy projects.\nAndy Atkins is executive director of Friends of the Earth.\nInterested in finding out more about how you can live better?

        "conteudo": "One icy morning in February 2012, Hillary Clinton’s plane touched down in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, which was just digging out from a fierce blizzard. Wrapped in a thick coat, the secretary of state descended the stairs to the snow-covered tarmac, where she and her aides piled into a motorcade bound for the presidential palace. That afternoon, they huddled with Bulgarian leaders, including prime minister Boyko Borissov, discussing everything from Syria’s bloody civil war to their joint search for loose nukes. But the focus of the talks was fracking. The previous year, Bulgaria had signed a five-year, $68m deal, granting US oil giant Chevron millions of acres in shale gas concessions. Bulgarians were outraged. Shortly before Clinton arrived, tens of thousands of protesters poured into the streets carrying placards that read “Stop fracking with our water” and “Chevron go home.” Bulgaria’s parliament responded by voting overwhelmingly for a fracking moratorium.\nClinton urged Bulgarian officials to give fracking another chance. According to Borissov, she agreed to help fly in the “best specialists on these new technologies to present the benefits to the Bulgarian people.” But resistance only grew. The following month in neighbouring Romania, thousands of people gathered to protest another Chevron fracking project, and Romania’s parliament began weighing its own shale gas moratorium. Again Clinton intervened, dispatching her special envoy for energy in Eurasia, Richard Morningstar, to push back against the fracking bans. The State Depart­ment’s lobbying effort culminated in late May 2012, when Morningstar held a series of meetings on fracking with top Bulgarian and Romanian officials. He also touted the technology in an interview on Bulgarian national radio, saying it could lead to a fivefold drop in the price of natural gas. A few weeks later, Romania’s parliament voted down its proposed fracking ban and Bulgaria’s eased its moratorium.\nThe episode sheds light on a crucial but little-known dimension of Clinton’s diplomatic legacy. Under her leadership, the State Department worked closely with energy companies to spread fracking around the globe—part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel. But environmental groups fear that exporting fracking, which has been linked to drinking-water contamination and earthquakes at home, could wreak havoc in countries with scant environmental regulation. And according to interviews, diplomatic cables, and other documents obtained by Mother Jones, American officials—some with deep ties to industry—also helped US firms clinch potentially lucrative shale concessions overseas, raising troubling questions about whose interests the programme actually serves.\nGeologists have long known that there were huge quantities of natural gas locked in shale rock. But tapping it wasn’t economically viable until the late 1990s, when a Texas wildcatter named George Mitchell hit on a novel extraction method that involved drilling wells sideways from the initial borehole, then blasting them full of water, chemicals, and sand to break up the shale—a variation of a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Besides dislodging a bounty of natural gas, Mitchell’s breakthrough ignited an energy revolution. Between 2006 and 2008, domestic gas reserves jumped 35%. The United States later vaulted past Russia to become the world’s largest natural gas producer. As a result, prices dropped to record lows, and America began to wean itself from coal, along with oil and gas imports, which lessened its dependence on the Middle East. The surging global gas supply also helped shrink Russia’s economic clout: profits for Russia’s state-owned gas company, Gazprom, plummeted by more than 60% between 2008 and 2009 alone.\nClinton, who was sworn in as secretary of state in early 2009, believed that shale gas could help rewrite global energy politics. “This is a moment of profound change,” she later told a crowd at Georgetown University. “Countries that used to depend on others for their energy are now producers. How will this shape world events? Who will benefit, and who will not? … The answers to these questions are being written right now, and we intend to play a major role.” Clinton tapped a lawyer named David Goldwyn as her special envoy for international energy affairs; his charge was “to elevate energy diplomacy as a key function of US foreign policy.”\nGoldwyn had a long history of promoting drilling overseas—both as a Department of Energy official under Bill Clinton and as a representative of the oil industry. From 2005 to 2009 he directed the US-Libya Business Association, an organisation funded primarily by US oil companies—including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and Marathon—clamouring to tap Libya’s abundant supply. Goldwyn lobbied Congress for pro-Libyan policies and even battled legislation that would have allowed families of the Lockerbie bombing victims to sue the Libyan government for its alleged role in the attack.\nDavid Goldwyn, former US co-ordinator for international energy affairs, with Teddy Taylor, former US ambassador to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, in front of the Interoil refinery, in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, in 2010. Photograph: US State Department\nAccording to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, one of Goldwyn’s first acts at the State Department was gathering oil and gas industry executives “to discuss the potential international impact of shale gas.” Clinton then sent a cable to US diplomats, asking them to collect information on the potential for fracking in their host countries. These efforts eventually gave rise to the Global Shale Gas Initiative, which aimed to help other nations develop their shale potential. Clinton promised it would do so “in a way that is as environmentally respectful as possible.”\nBut environmental groups were barely consulted, while industry played a crucial role. When Goldwyn unveiled the initiative in April 2010, it was at a meeting of the United States Energy Association, a trade organisation representing Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and ConocoPhillips, all of which were pursuing fracking overseas. Among their top targets was Poland, which preliminary studies suggested had abundant shale gas. The day after Goldwyn’s announcement, the US embassy in Warsaw helped organise a shale gas conference, underwritten by these same companies (plus the oil field services company Halliburton) and attended by officials from the departments of state and energy.\nIn some cases, Clinton personally promoted shale gas. During a 2010 gathering of foreign ministers in Washington, DC, she spoke about America’s plans to help spread fracking abroad. “I know that in some places [it] is controversial,” she said, “but natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today.” She later traveled to Poland for a series of meetings with officials, after which she announced that the country had joined the Global Shale Gas Initiative.\nThat August, delegates from 17 countries descended on Washington for the State Depart­ment’s first shale gas conference. The media was barred from attending, and officials refused to reveal basic information, including which countries took part. When Rep Henry Waxman (D-Calif) inquired about industry involvement, the department would say only that there had been “a limited industry presence.” (State Department officials have since been more forthcoming with Mother Jones: In addition to a number of US government agencies, they say attendees heard from energy firms, including Devon, Chesapeake, and Halliburton.)\nDuring the cursory press conference that followed, Goldwyn, a short, bespectacled man with a shock of dark hair, argued that other nations could avoid the environmental damage sometimes associated with fracking by following America’s lead and adopting “an umbrella of laws and regulations.” A reporter suggested that US production had actually “outpaced the ability to effectively oversee the safety” and asked how we could be sure the same wouldn’t happen elsewhere. Goldwyn replied that attendees had heard about safety issues from energy companies and the Groundwater Protection Council, a nonprofit organisation that receives industry funding and opposes federal regulation of fracking wastewater disposal.\nGoldwyn and the delegates then boarded a bus to Pennsylvania for an industry-sponsored luncheon and tour of some shale fields. Paul Hueper, director of energy programmes at the State Department’s bureau of energy resources, says the tour was organised independently and that energy firms were only invited to the conference itself to share best practices. “We are very firm on this,” he insisted. “We do not shill for industry.”\nWhile the meeting helped stir up interest, it wasn’t until 2011 that global fracking fever set in for real. That spring, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its initial estimate of global shale gas, which found that 32 countries had viable shale basins and put global recoverable shale gas at 6,600tn cubic feet—enough to supply the world for more than 50 years at current rates of consumption. This was a rich opportunity for big oil and gas companies, which had largely missed out on the US fracking boom and were under pressure from Wall Street to shore up their dwindling reserves. “They’re desperate,” says Antoine Simon, who coordinates the shale gas campaign at Friends of the Earth Europe. “It’s the last push to continue their fossil fuel development.”\nThe industry began fighting hard for access to shale fields abroad, and promoting gas as the fuel of choice for slashing carbon emissions. In Europe, lobbyists circulated a report claiming that the European Union could save €900bn if it invested in gas rather than renewable energy to meet its 2050 climate targets. This rankled environmentalists, who argue fracking may do little to ease global warming, given that wells and pipelines leak large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. They also fear it could crowd out investment in renewables.\nBy early 2011, the State Department was laying plans to launch a new bureau to integrate energy into every aspect of foreign policy—an idea Goldwyn had long been advocating. In 2005, he and a Chevron executive named Jan Kalicki had published a book called Energy and Security: Toward a New Foreign Policy Strategy, which argued that energy independence was unattainable in the near term and urged Washington to shift its focus to energy security—by boosting global fossil fuel production and stifling unrest that might upset energy markets. Goldwyn and his ideas had played a key role in shaping the bureau, so some observers were surprised when he quietly stepped down just before its launch.\nWhen I approached Goldwyn following a recent speaking engagement in Washington, DC, to ask about his time at the State Department and why he left, he ducked out a side door, and Kalicki blocked the corridor to keep me from following. Goldwyn later said via email that he had simply chosen “to return to the private sector.”\nAround the time of his departure, WikiLeaks released a slew of diplomatic cables, including one describing a 2009 meeting during which Goldwyn and Canadian officials discussed development of the Alberta oil sands—a project benefiting some of the same firms behind the US-Libya Business Association. The cable said that Goldwyn had coached his Canadian counterparts on improving “oil sands messaging” and helped alleviate their concerns about getting oil sands crude to US markets. This embarrassed the State Department, which is reviewing the controversial Keystone XL pipeline proposal to transport crude oil from Canada and is under fire from environmentalists.\nAfter leaving State, Goldwyn took a job with Sutherland, a law and lobbying firm that touts his “deep understanding” of pipeline issues, and launched his own company, Goldwyn Global Strategies.\nIn late 2011, Clinton finally unveiled the new Bureau of Energy Resources, with 63 employees and a multimillion-dollar budget. She also promised to instruct US embassies around the globe to step up their work on energy issues and “pursue more outreach to private-sector energy” firms, some of which had generously supported both her and President Barack Obama’s political campaigns. (One Chevron executive bundled large sums for Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid, for example.)\nAs part of its expanded energy mandate, the State Department hosted conferences on fracking from Thailand to Botswana. It sent US experts to work alongside foreign officials as they developed shale gas programs. And it arranged for dozens of foreign delegations to visit the United States to attend workshops and meet with industry consultants—as well as with environmental groups, in some cases.\nUS oil giants, meanwhile, were snapping up natural gas leases in far-flung places. By 2012, Chevron had large shale concessions in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, and South Africa, as well as in eastern Europe, which was in the midst of a claim-staking spree; Poland alone had granted more than 100 shale concessions covering nearly a third of its territory. When the nation lit its first shale gas flare atop a Halliburton-drilled well that fall, the state-owned gas company ran full-page ads in the country’s largest newspapers showing a spindly rig rising above the hills in the tiny village of Lubocino, alongside the tagline: “Don’t put out the flame of hope.” Politicians promised that Poland would soon break free of its nemesis, Russia, which supplies the lion’s share of its gas. “After years of dependence on our large neighbour, today we can say that my generation will see the day when we will be independent in the area of natural gas,” prime minister Donald Tusk declared. “And we will be setting terms.”\nBut shale was not the godsend that industry leaders and foreign governments had hoped it would be. For one, new research from the US Geological Survey suggested that the EIA assessments had grossly overestimated shale deposits: the recoverable shale gas estimate for Poland shrank from 187tn cubic feet to 1.3tn cubic feet, a 99%. Geological conditions and other factors in Europe and Asia also made fracking more arduous and expensive; one industry study estimated that drilling shale gas in Poland would cost three times what it does in the United States.\nBy 2013, US oil giants were abandoning their Polish shale plays. “The expectations for global shale gas were extremely high,” says the State Department’s Hueper. “But the geological limitations and aboveground challenges are immense. A handful of countries have the potential for a boom, but there may never be a global shale gas revolution.”\nThe politics of fracking overseas were also fraught. According to Susan Sakmar, a visiting law professor at the University of Houston who has studied fracking regulation, the United States is one of the only nations where individual landowners own the mineral rights. “In most, perhaps all, other countries of the world, the underground resources belong to the crown or the government,” she explains. The fact that property owners didn’t stand to profit from drilling on their land ignited public outrage in some parts of the world, especially eastern Europe. US officials speculate that Russia also had a hand in fomenting protests there. “The perception among diplomats in the region was that Russia was protecting its interests,” says Mark Gitenstein, the former US ambassador to Romania. “It didn’t want shale gas for obvious reasons.”\nFaced with these obstacles, US and European energy companies launched a lobbying blitz targeting the European Union. They formed faux grassroots organisations, plied lawmakers with industry-funded studies, and hosted lavish dinners and conferences for regulators. The website for one industry confab—which, according to Friends of the Earth Europe, featured presentations from Exxon Mobil, Total, and Halliburton—warned that failure to develop shale gas “will have damaging consequences on European energy security and prosperity” and urged European governments to “allow shale gas exploration to advance” so they could “fully understand the scale of the opportunity.”\nUS lobbying shops also jumped into the fray. Covington & Burling, a major Washington firm, hired several former senior EU policymakers—including a top energy official who, according to the New York Times, arrived with a not-yet-public draft of the European commission’s fracking regulations.\nIn June 2013, Covington staffer Jean De Ruyt, a former Belgian diplomat and adviser to the European commission, hosted an event at the firm’s Brussels office. Executives from Chevron and other oil and gas behemoths attended, as did Kurt Vandenberghe, then one of the commission’s top environmental regulators. These strategies appeared to pay off: The commission’s recently released framework for regulating fracking includes recommendations for governments but not firm requirements. “They chose the weakest option they had,” says Simon of Friends of the Earth Europe. “People at the highest level of the commission are in the industry’s pocket.”\nGoldwyn was also busy promoting fracking overseas—this time on behalf of industry. Between January and October 2012, his firm organised a series of workshops on fracking for officials in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine, all of them funded by Chevron. The events were closed to the public—when Romanian journalist Vlad Ursulean tried to attend the Romanian gathering, he says Goldwyn personally saw to it that he was escorted out.\nGoldwyn told Mother Jones that the workshops featured presentations on technical aspects of fracking by academics from the Colorado School of Mines and Penn State University. Chevron, he maintains, had “no editorial input.” But all of these countries—except Bulgaria, which was in the midst of anti-fracking protests—would later grant Chevron major shale concessions.\nIn some cases, the State Department had a direct hand in negotiating the deals. Gitenstein, then the ambassador to Romania, met with Chevron executives and Romanian officials and pressed them to hand over millions of acres of shale concessions. “The Romanians were just sitting on the leases, and Chevron was upset. So I intervened,” says Gitenstein, whose State Department tenure has been bookended by stints at Mayer Brown, a law and lobbying firm that has represented Chevron. “This is traditionally what ambassadors do on behalf of American companies.” In the end, Romania signed a 30-year deal with Chevron, which helped set off massive, nationwide protests.\nWhen the government began weighing a fracking ban, it didn’t sit well with Gitenstein, who went on Romanian television and warned that, without fracking, the nation could be stuck paying five times what America does for natural gas. He added that US shale prospectors had “obtained great successes—without consequences for the environment, I dare say.” The proposed moratorium soon died.\nA few weeks later, Chevron was preparing to build its first fracking rig near Pungesti, a tiny farming village in northeastern Romania. According to a memo from the prime minister’s office, a Romanian official met with Chevron executives and an embassy-based US Commerce Department employee to craft a PR strategy for the project. They agreed to organise a kickoff event at Victoria Palace in Bucharest. As a spokesman, they would tap Damian Draghici, a charismatic Romanian lawmaker who was a “recognised personality among the Roma minority,” which had a “considerable presence” around Chevron’s planned drilling sites. “It was really extraordinary—the level of collaboration between these players,” says Ursulean, who has written extensively about Chevron’s activities in Romania. “It was as if they were all branches of the same company.”\nThe strategy did little to soothe the public’s ire. When Chevron finally did attempt to install the rig in late 2013, residents—including elderly villagers who arrived in horse-drawn carts—blockaded the planned drilling sites. The Romanian Orthodox Church rallied behind them, with one local priest likening Chevron to enemy “invaders.” Soon, anti-fracking protests were cropping up from Poland to the United Kingdom. But Chevron didn’t back down. Along with other American energy firms, it lobbied to insert language in a proposed US-EU trade agreement allowing US companies to haul European governments before international arbitration panels for any actions threatening their investments. Chevron argued this was necessary to protect shareholders against “arbitrary” and “unfair” treatment by local authorities. But environmental groups say it would stymie fracking regulation and point to a $250m lawsuit Delaware-based Lone Pine Resources has filed against the Canadian province of Quebec for temporarily banning fracking near a key source of drinking water. The case hinges on a similar trade provision.\nDespite the public outcry in Europe, the State Department has stayed the course. Clinton’s successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, views natural gas as a key part of his push against climate change. Under Kerry, State has ramped up investment in its shale gas initiative and is planning to expand it to 30 more countries, from Cambodia to Papua New Guinea.\nFollowing the Crimea crisis, the Obama administration has also been pressing eastern European countries to fast-track their fracking initiatives so as to be less dependent on Russia. During an April visit to Ukraine, which has granted concessions to Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, vice president Joe Biden announced that the United States would bring in technical experts to speed up its shale gas development. “We stand ready to assist you,” promised Biden, whose son Hunter has since joined the board of a Ukrainian energy company. “Imagine where you’d be today if you were able to tell Russia: ‘Keep your gas.’ It would be a very different world.”\nThis story was supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism",

        "conteudo": "It seems obvious, but apparently it isn’t. If you remove the reality of climate change from government decision-making you risk making the wrong decisions.\nObviously the drought is causing extreme hardship for farmers in parts of New South Wales and Queensland and the government is about to announce a package of short-term measures to assist them.\nBut surely long-term drought policy needs to take into account the evidence that climate change means rainfall patterns are changing and that also means changes in what can be farmed, and where.\nAsked about this on Monday, prime minister Tony Abbott appeared to suggest it did not.\nHe said records going back 150 years showed there had always been “good times and bad times”, that there had been “droughts since the beginning of settlement”.\nIn other words, just as the government refused to accept climate change might lead to an increased frequency of bushfire weather, it also appears to reject the idea that climate change might have a bearing on the frequency or location of drought, or on the long-term farming conditions of particular farming areas.\nPresident Barack Obama sees the link between US weather patterns, farming and climate change. Meeting drought-stricken farmers in California on Friday he foreshadowed a $1bn “climate resilience fund”.\nAnd before the Abbott government abolished it, the independent climate commission in its Critical Decade report suggested Australia was facing similar pressures.\nIt said that “changing rainfall patterns, the increasing risk of extreme heat and bushfire weather present challenges for Australian agriculture. Production of temperature and water sensitive broad acre crops, fruit, vegetables and wine grapes need to adapt to these changing growing conditions or move to locations where growing conditions are more amenable to their production.”\nSimilarly, the just-announced review of the renewable energy target is asking the right questions but seems to be driven more by some exaggerated assessments of the impact of the RET on power bills and less by why it could be a good idea to continue to encourage the use of more renewable energy.\nAfter recent cabinet divisions about who should do the review and how far it should go, Abbott told Alan Jones on Monday morning the government was “very close” to announcing it, and that it would report within months.\nAsked by Jones, “how can we justify providing subsidies to solar energy and wind power with borrowed money when many of those companies are foreign companies, Thai companies for example?”, Abbott replied, “well, that is a very fair point, Alan, and that is why we are very close to announcing a review into this which will report in a matter of months and then the government will have more to say because just as the carbon tax is massively boosting power prices, the renewable energy targets are also having an impact on prices. Not as great, but still not insignificant. What this government wants to do is bear down on prices.”\nLast December, Abbott described the price impact of the Renewable Energy Target (RET) as “pretty significant”.\nAccording to the Australian Energy Market Commission in 2013-14 the RET was responsible for around 4% of the average household bill, falling to a likely 3.1% in 2014-15.\nOther estimates, from the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal and the Queensland Competition Authority, fall within a range of between 3% and 5% of retail electricity bills.\nBut because the RET is already providing ongoing subsidies to existing renewable energy projects, reducing or removing it will not translate into an immediate removal of the small price impact it has had so far.\nModelling for the climate change authority by Sinclair Knight Merz found removing the RET altogether would reduce an average household bill by just $15 a year.\nAnd the climate change authority, when it last reviewed the RET in December 2012, found there was a good case to keep it to continue to encourage investment in renewable power.\nOf course if it hadn’t factored in the impact of climate change or the long-term need to change Australia’s fossil fuel use in response to it, it would have come up with a very different calculation.",

That is why the European Union intends to fully meet our commitments to the poorest countries and will meet the millennium development goal of 0.7 [%] in 2015.\"\nMeanwhile, the development commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, was expected on Wednesday to offer fresh support to UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon's energy-access initiative. \"Through the promotion of our technology and expertise, combined with a targeted use of our aid funding, we will aim to increase access to modern energy services for the world's poorest,\" Piebalgs said on the eve of an address at the European parliament.\nThe pledges reflect officials' hopes that the EU can be a catalyst in turning the UN conference on sustainable development into a ground-breaking shift towards low-carbon, resource-efficient economic growth after disappointments at recent climate and development summits. The conference is to take place on 20-22 June in Rio de Janeiro, 20 years after the Brazilian city hosted the first earth summit.\n\"We are trying to work hard to ensure that we will obtain concrete results,\" Potocnik said, adding: \"A day will not pass by in the coming months where the Rio outcome will not be discussed in our contacts with international partners.\"\nEU officials cite Europe's commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, boost the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency as a way to tackle climate change while transforming economies and creating jobs.\nPotocnik also said it was a European priority to give the Nairobi-based Unep more influence and resources.\nBut the European commission, the EU's executive, faces tall hurdles if it is to achieve some of these goals. Many EU countries are economically stagnant and face rising unemployment. At a summit on 30 January, EU leaders pledged to create more jobs and spur growth to address a continent-wide malaise and sovereign debt problems that have forced the union's leaders to ask for help from China and other countries with deep cash reserves.\nEU leaders have traditionally seen overseas aid as an extension of their \"soft power\", agreeing in 2002 to provide annual development aid equivalent to 0.51% of GNI by 2010, and 0.7% by 2015 for the 15 richest EU nations.\nYet there are doubts about whether the EU can really live up to its aid commitments.\nA 2011 study by the Concord coalition of advocacy organisations said that despite the €54bn ($71.5bn) in aid provided by the EU in 2010, only nine of the union's 27 countries kept or exceeded their promises on aid in 2010. The overall rate is 0.43% of GNI. The Concord group warns that at current levels of spending, aid will barely move beyond that, to 0.45%, by 2015.\n\"To succeed, Rio will need to put more money on the table to fund the move towards an economy based on sustainable development,\" Felix Dodds, executive director of the London-based Stakeholder Forum, said on Tuesday at a development conference organised by the European Economic and Social Committee, an EU body.\nDodds, whose organisation promotes sustainable development, suggests ways in addition to development aid to create greener growth: a tax on financial transactions – backed by the European commission but opposed by Britain and Ireland – and shifting the estimated $4.7 trillion held by global sovereign wealth funds into green investments.\nDodds said the consequences of inaction are high. Referring to the EU's aid commitment, he said: \"If they do not do that, then seriously we are in danger of losing any trust with developing countries.\"",

        "conteudo": "President Barack Obama included a call to action on climate change in his inaugural speech on 21 January, surprising those who believed gun violence and immigration reform would take top billing. It's not the first time he's talked about the issue, by any means, but few thought he would return to it with such emphasis now.\nDuring his 2008 campaign, he spoke of working for the moment when the rise of the oceans would begin to slow and our planet would begin to heal. During the 2012 election campaign, he was mocked for that statement.\nBut no one was laughing this fall when waves swept over lower Manhattan and towns up and down the eastern seaboard; nor this summer when much of the US midwest suffered from drought and brave firefighters battled unprecedented fires across the west. Obama spoke in Monday's inaugural address of our responsibility to \"preserve our planet\", recognizing that \"the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations\".\nSo can we expect the president to take the sort of leadership on the climate that many have hoped for since his 2008 campaign? In particular, will he stand up to the pressure of the fossil fuel lobby?\nHere are the top things he can do to turn those intentions into the actions that would be up to the scale of the problem. Many of them can happen without the consent of congressional Republicans.\nFirst, President Obama proposed a national conversation on climate during his first post-2012 election press conference. He should launch that conversation with clear statements about the urgency of the climate science, an explanation of what is at stake, and a call to all Americans to be part of the change.\nIt's important that he not dumb this down. We need to know what it means to have experienced record-breaking temperatures, floods, droughts, wild fires, melting ice caps, and extreme storms. When given a full account of a threat, the American people have risen to big challenges in the past. We did it during the second world war when millions enlisted in the military, grew \"victory gardens\", recycled, and went to work in factories to aid the war effort. He should call on us to be the next \"greatest generation\".\nSecond, he should drop the \"all of the above\" approach to energy development. As Bill McKibben of 350.org shows, 80% of the fossil fuel now in the ground must stay there if we are to stabilize an increasingly chaotic climate. That means instead of giving subsidies, tax breaks, and a regulatory pass to fossil fuel companies, these advantages should instead be given to businesses developing renewables and energy efficiency.\nThird, he should propose a straightforward tax on carbon. This approach actually has the support of such Republicans as George Shultz, as well as former top aides to Mitt Romney and John McCain. Even ExxonMobile says it could support such a tax. A carbon tax would send the right market signal, nudging our economy toward one that is safe for the planet. The billions of dollars raised by such a tax could help pay down the deficit, pay for investments in the clean energy economy, or be rebated directly to every American.\nFinally, Obama should use the regulatory authority he already has. He should put a permanent stop to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport some of the most carbon-intensive, polluting oil on the planet across the American heartland. He should instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to move ahead aggressively with regulation of existing power plants, which account for 40% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.\nStepping up to the climate challenge need not compete with the other goals he outlined in his inauguration speech. Building a clean energy economy will produce good jobs that lift more people into the middle class and build a sustainable and widely shared prosperity. Reducing fossil fuel pollutants will improve our health and reduce healthcare costs.\nLess reliance on fossil fuels will bolster our security. And we could avoid spending untold sums cleaning up after massive storms and adapting to droughts and rising sea levels.\nObama's speech shows he has the potential to be not just an historic president but a transformational one. Hopes have been raised and dashed before, though. If there was ever a moment for Barack Obama to take a stand and establish a legacy, this is it.\nEighty percent of Americans agree that inaction on climate change would have serious consequences. The fact that he need not run for re-election frees him from the need to placate the oil and coal lobby. And scientists agree we have only a few years to change directions if we are to avert a climate catastrophe that would dash the hopes of generations to come.\nThis project is far too big for any one person, even the president of the United States. Our best hope is an inside-outside strategy – one in which the Obama administration reaches out to those who are already on the front lines battling the climate crisis, as well as those who are just now coming to recognize the threat we face. And those on the outside must reciprocate.\nObama says we can lead the way together. People across the country and the globe have been doing so. Now is the time for the president to join them and take the bold actions that will serve generations to come.",

        "conteudo": "Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of King’s College London’s (KCL) most revered former students, has intervened after the university rejected a demand from 1,400 staff and students to sell off its fossil fuel investments.\nThe university says it supports relationships with fossil fuel companies “as long as they are open about any harm they might do, and that they are taking action to minimise this harm”. The vice principal dealing with the staff and students, Chris Mottershead, spent 30 years working for oil giant BP.\nTutu, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize for his work in ending South Africa’s apartheid regime, is a strong supporter of fossil fuel divestment. “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,” he told the Guardian in 2014. “It is clear [fossil fuel companies] are not simply going to give up; they stand to make too much money.”\nClimate campaign sign up\nTutu completed both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at KCL. “Archbishop Tutu is in conversation with the administration at Kings College, his alma mater, on the subject of fossil fuel divestment. The Archbishop has in the past clearly stated his support for this,” said a spokesman for the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.\nA series of analyses have shown that current reserves of coal, oil and gas are several times greater than can burned whilst limiting climate change to the internationally agreed limit of 2C. The fast-growing, UN-backed divestment campaign argues that the business models of fossil fuel companies, which continue to spend billions on searching for new reserves, are endangering the climate and would become worthless if the world’s governments act on global warming. The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign is asking the world’s two biggest health charities to divest.\n“I hope that King’s will listen to its most beloved alumnus and a man revered around the world as a moral voice,” said Mark Horowitz, from the Fossil Free KCL campaign. “He may be able to remind King’s that where they invest their money has ramifications beyond our campus.”\nKCL has more than £8m invested in fossil fuels but has no investments in renewable energy. The Fossil Free KCL campaign also discovered indirect KCL investments in the tobacco industry, which contravenes the university’s investment policy. At an open KCL debate in February, Mottershead was asked whether his 30-year BP career was a conflict of interest, replying: “Yes”.\nA spokeswoman for KCL said Mottershead’s admission was “slightly tongue-in-cheek”, as he has a “personal commitment to moving ‘beyond petroleum’” and has chaired a low-carbon vehicle task force. KCL would sell its tobacco investments in “a managed but timely way”, she said.\nIn his response to Fossil Free KCL, the university’s head, Ed Byrne, wrote: “We are ... in general, supportive of relationships with companies in the fossil fuel and defence sectors which collaborate with us on important research and education initiatives, as long as they are open about any harm they might do, and that they are taking action to minimise this harm.”\nThe KCL spokeswoman said the decision to invest in or work with companies was “based on the overall behaviour of the organisation, rather than simply about the sector within which they operate.”\nFossil Free King’s College London campaign poster showing Desmond Tutu. Photograph: Fossil Free KCL\nFossil Free KCL handed in its petition and a 45-page report in October and participated in the debate in February. “The debate seemed nothing more than a show trial as the university has not taken any tangible step to consider the possibility of divestment,” said Horowitz. “It is difficult for us to believe that our arguments are being considered in good faith when there is a clear conflict of interest.”\nMark Campanale, founder of Carbon Tracker Initiative, a think tank that has pioneered the analysis of the financial risks posed by fossil fuel investments, told the KCL debate: “The problem we have is that the profits that the fossil fuel companies are making are being deployed into developing even more fossil fuels we can’t burn. We have a fossil fuel industry that is in a state of denial.”\nMike Hulme, professor of climate and culture at KCL spoke against divestment at the debate: “I can understand why divestment is born out of a sense of frustration [but] it is, I am afraid, the latest stage of symbolic political campaigning around climate change. What divestment is asking for is for companies to commit suicide. It gives no operating space for shareholder pressure to change how those companies operate.”",

With less than a fortnight to go until the controversial packs are finally with us, the scheme's many opponents mounted a multi-pronged attack.\nWhile the chartered surveyors' body Rics launched a legal challenge, and opposition MPs tried — and failed — to block the reforms at the 11th hour, some estate agents claimed the scheme would severely damage the property market. The Haart chain says the rules are a mess, and unless the government amends the legislation, \"it will have a housing crash on its hands on June 1\" — the date the scheme goes live across England and Wales.\n\"Panic is spreading among sellers as they start to realise the full implications of the ill-conceived Hips,\" says Rics member Mark Hunter at agents Grice & Hunter in Doncaster, south Yorkshire, while Edward Waterson at Carter Jonas in York say he expects \"mayhem\".\nTheir predictions make for worrying reading if you are looking to sell in the coming months — but is a Hips- triggered property slump really likely? Money talked to a number of experts, including top economists, and found that most rejected the idea of a crash brought on by the sellers' packs alone.\nBut the one big unknown is whether there will be enough home inspectors trained and ready to start visiting sellers' houses to assess their energy efficiency. The government says there will be; the critics say there won't.\nThose who take the view that the property market won't be rocked to its foundations by Hips point to:\nThe fact that people move home for a multitude of reasons — a new job, an expanding family, to be near a good school etc — and this won't change a jot after June 1. Many of them don't have the luxury of staying put simply because they don't want the hassle of having to assemble a pack.\n\"Looking at the longer-term, we don't think they are really going to have much of an impact at all,\" says Martin Ellis, chief economist at Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender. \"Yes, it is an additional cost, but in the grand scheme of things, people need to move house because they need to move house . . . It's not going to stop people moving.\"\nThe fact that the cost of a Hip is fairly small beer when the average UK house price is now north of £200,000. Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol says that when Hips were going to cost £800-£1,000, they would have had an impact on the housing market. Many \"speculative\" sellers would have been reluctant to spend that sort of money, and estate agents wouldn't have been able to offer them for free, as some are doing.\nBut last summer the government announced it was scrapping the requirement for a survey (the \"home condition report\") to be included in the pack. That reduced the typical cost of a pack to about £300-£500. Some agents have said they will offer them on a \"no sale, no fee\" basis.\nAnother argument against the price crash theory is that if Hips chaos does result in a desperate shortage of homes for sale post-June 1, it seems much more likely that property values will go up, not down. Lack of supply almost always means higher prices.\nOne fear is that there simply aren't enough trained \"domestic energy assessors\" — the people who must check a property's energy efficiency before it can be put up for sale — and that this will seriously gum up the works.\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government says 2,000 energy assessors will be needed at the beginning of June, rising to 2,500 by the end of the month. \"More than 2,500 have already passed exams, with a further 3,000 in training,\" it adds.\nMoney this week visited Wealdstone in Middlesex — one of the cheaper parts of outer London where a typical three-bed semi costs £275,000 to £300,000 — to see what independent estate agents thought.\nColin Barrington at Rawlinson Gold, which has four branches in the area, had expected a rush of new \"instructions\" (sellers) ahead of Hips. \"We thought human nature would cause a rush. But it just did not happen. Business levels are consistent with the time of year and the state of the property market. It didn't happen because the cost is negligible in the context of overall expenses, while interest rate rises have made people more cautious.\"\nJoan McPhillips at Connaught says: \"We're not seeing anything different from what we would expect and we don't think the Hip will make any difference to our business. While we haven't decided, yet, how to cost it, we believe people will accept it within months and not notice it at all.\"\nMukesh Metha at London Properties says \"the change is good. When vendors have to pay, they will be more serious and this will cut out the time-wasters. The new scheme and its alleged problems have been over-hyped by some big London chains. It certainly won't put us out of business or hit property prices here.\"\nDinesh Shonchhatra at Major Estates believes \"this is just people making a fuss – we have no worries about Hips, and it will all die down by the end of the summer.\"",

        "conteudo": "President Barack Obama has committed to fight global warming. In just his first few weeks in office, the president has already taken steps to move America in a direction that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The most important step so far is the indication that tailpipe emissions will be regulated as needed for improved fuel efficiency. Similar steps will be needed to improve energy efficiencies in buildings and homes.\nIn my opinion, and in the view of most economists, these steps must be accompanied by a rising price on carbon emissions, if we hope to stabilise atmospheric composition. Incentives must be provided for economic development that steadily replaces outdated fossil fuel based energy infrastructure. Such transformation is needed if we are to preserve for future generations the remarkable planet that we inherited from our elders.\nNow Obama is about to head off on his first foreign trip – destination Canada. Few realise that Canada is America's number-one source of oil. And, unlike energy conversations in prior administrations, science and the environment are expected to be an important part of the agenda. Let us hope so.\nThe Canadian press is full of speculation that the Canadian government will push for special treatment and protections from global warming regulation of its fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions: the tar sands oil development in Alberta, where much of Canada's oil is derived. Such protection would be disastrous for life on our planet.\nThe tar sands of Canada constitute one of our planet's greatest threats. They are a double-barrelled threat. First, producing oil from tar sands emits two-to-three times the global warming pollution of conventional oil. But the process also diminishes one of the best carbon-reduction tools on the planet: Canada's Boreal Forest.\nThis forest plays a key role in the global carbon equation by serving as a major storehouse for terrestrial carbon – indeed, it is believed to store more carbon per hectare than any other ecosystem on Earth. When this pristine forest is strip mined for tar sands development, much of its stored carbon is lost. Canada's Boreal Forest is also the reservoir for a large fraction of North America's clean, fresh water, home to some five billion migratory birds, and some of largest remaining populations of caribou, moose, bear and wolves on the planet.\nAs a climate scientist, I am focused on what levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide can be considered safe. In the past few years, based on increasingly detailed information about the history of the Earth and observations of ongoing climate change, a startling conclusion has become apparent. The safe level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is no more than 350 parts per million (ppm), if we wish the diversity of other species on the planet to survive – as well as \"amenities\" that humans require, such as fresh water supplies, stable coastlines and a normal degree of extreme weather events.\nUnfortunately, because of our fossil fuel use, our planet is already at 385 ppm. It is still practical, with improved agricultural and forestry practices to get future carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm, provided we phase out emissions from the largest source, coal, in coming decades. It is a tough challenge to develop the needed renewable energies of the future, but it is doable. Together with improved energy efficiency we can move to the clean world of the future, beyond fossil fuels.\nSo an underlying fact has become crystal clear. The horrendously carbon-intensive unconventional fossil fuels, tar shale in the US and tar sands in Canada, cannot be developed. The carbon emissions from tar shale and tar sands would initiate a continual unfolding of climate disasters over the course of this century. We would be miserable stewards of creation. We would rob our own children and grandchildren.\nNow is a critical moment in the history of our planet. The US and Canadian governments must agree that the unconventional fossil fuels, tar sands and tar shale, will not be developed. They will thus send a message that their statements recognising \"a planet in peril\" are not empty rhetoric. They will provide hope to young people and nature. We can preserve our heritage with its remarkable diversity of life.",

        "conteudo": "8pm: President Obama's 2012 state of the union address tonight comes as the first salvos of the US presidential campaign are being fired. So far it has been the Republican contenders who have been dishing it out – and tonight is Barack Obama's first big chance to seize the nation's attention.\nTonight Obama has to walk the line between being the nation's commander in chief making new proposals and as an incumbent running for re-election in 10 months time, with the weak American economy once again hanging over proceedings.\nThe address itself – a requirement of the president mandated in the US constitution – starts at 9pm ET (2am GMT), when Obama address the joint houses of Congress as well as members of his administration, cabinet and the US supreme court.\nBut the real audience is the tens of millions viewers watching at home, with the address carried live on the major networks – ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC – and the Spanish language channels Telemundo and Univision, as well as the cable news channels CNN, CNBC, Fox News and MSNBC.\nLast year's state of the union address reached 48 million people, according to Neilsen, while George Bush's final address in 2007 drew 32 million.\nWe'll be live blogging the speech itself and all the reaction, including the official response from Mitch Daniels, the Republican governor of Indiana, and the GOP presidential candidates, including Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney.\nFeel free to leave your comments below. Before we get underway, catch up with the action on the Republican campaign trail with our live blog of the day's activity.\n8.05pm: We already have excerpts released by the White House ahead of the speech tonight – and the strongest line so far comes when Obama says: \"No bailouts, no handouts and no cop-outs\":\nThink about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.\n...\nThe defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them.\n…\nAs long as I'm president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.\nNo, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last – an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.\n...\nLet's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that does the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts and no cop-outs. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.\n8.15pm: Not to be outdone, the Republicans have released portions of Mitch Daniels's pre-butal from his official response to the state of the union:\nIt's not fair and it's not true for the President to attack Republicans in Congress as obstacles on these questions. They and they alone have passed bills to reduce borrowing, reform entitlements, and encourage new job creation, only to be shot down nearly time and again by the President and his Democrat Senate allies.\n...\nNo feature of the Obama Presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others. As in previous moments of national danger, we Americans are all in the same boat. If we drift, quarreling and paralyzed, over a Niagara of debt, we will all suffer, regardless of income, race, gender, or other category. If we fail to shift to a pro-jobs, pro-growth economic policy, there will never be enough public revenue to pay for our safety net, national security, or whatever size government we decide to have.\nMitch Daniels isn't exactly the most dynamic speaker in the world. In fact he's usually not even the most dynamic speaker in an empty room. But doing the reply is tough: none of the trappings of power, and all the networks cut away after about two minutes – faster if they can manage it.\n8.30pm: And the lucky member of the cabinet – who gets to stay behind in a secure location in case something dreadful happens and wipes out the American political class in Congress – is former Iowa governor and current agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack.\nSo in the worst case scenario, there's America's 45th president.\n8.40pm: If you refresh your browser, you'll be able to see live video of the state of the union above on this page.\n8.45pm: Among the many guests of the president and first lady tonight is an unusual one: Warren Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek. Why?\nWell, Debbie Bosanek has become a figure of some national note, after her billionaire investor boss once suggested it was absurd that he should pay a lower tax rate than his secretary:\nThe face of the \"Buffett Rule,\" the tax policy President Obama is pushing, inspired by Buffett's assertion that he shouldn't pay a lower tax rate than his secretary does, says she doesn't have anything to add to a tax-policy debate.\n8.49pm: C-Span is the best channel to watch the state of the union on, because it just shows a live feed from the floor of Congress without commentary, and you get to look clever by saying \"Oh look there's that guy from whatever\" and so on.\nIt's basically prom night for elderly politicians.\nBros before the House: Joe Biden stands with House Speaker John Boehner tonight. Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n8.51pm: Speaker of the House John Boehner is gavelling everyone to order, and as usual he sounds as if he's knocked back a couple of stiff ones before stepping up to the podium. Not that he has, it's just his manner. But even if he had, well good for him.\n8.53pm: While we are waiting, here's some background on the usual TV viewing figures for the state of the union.\nAnd why not, here's the text of George Washington's very first state of the union address, which includes this:\nUniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to.\nWill Obama do the same? Doubtful. He probably yearns to impose a European socialist style metric system (I'm channeling Newt Gingrich's brain there).\n8.56pm: The joint session of Congress has risen as one for a standing ovation as congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords enters.\nGiffords was shot in the head in Tuscon last January, and although she has by all accounts made a remarkable recovery, she has recently announced that she is stepping down from Congress.\n9pm: Now the members of the Supreme Court and members of the cabinet – minus the agriculture secretary, as mentioned below – are making their way in to the chamber.\nJustices Roberts, Kennedy, Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan are all there. No Scalia or Thomas? No Sotomayor or Alito either.\n9.05pm: And there's the president and Michelle Obama. The first lady looks fabulous in a sapphire blue dress, while the president looks gorgeous in – how can I describe this? – a sort of dark blue \"suit\" with a maroon tie and a white shirt.\n— Larry Sabato (@LarrySabato) January 25, 2012\nDo they give POTUS Purell to use at the podium? Lots of germs on those hands. #sotu\nProfessor Larry Sabato is ever the practical one. Purell, for non-American readers, is a brand of hand sanitiser.\n9.09pm: If you are having problems with our live streaming video, please turn auto-updates to off and reload the page. Thanks.\nWe're just about under way.\n9.11pm: Here we go: Boehner announces the president of United States, standing ovation and then we are off:\nMr Speaker, Mr Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans.\nLast month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought – and several thousand gave their lives.\n9.12pm: Two quick standing ovations already, as Obama is going straight to his good stuff:\nFor the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al-Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.\n9.15pm: Obama is using the example of the US military in Iraq for the rest of the US economy, which is mildly creepy:\nImagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example.... We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of world war two, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known.\nFor that to happen, \"we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them.\"\n9.18pm: After the good news, Obama takes us on a tour of the smoking wreckage of the economy when he took office. And there's the money quote:\nThe state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum.\nThat's a smart twist: it would be hard for Obama to deliver the traditional \"the state of our Union is strong\" in the current economic climate – but \"getting stronger\" is good place-holder.\n9.21pm: And here's something a US president has not been able to say for a while: \"Tonight, the American auto industry is back.\"\nObama then mentions that a company named Master Lock, with a unionised plant in Milwaulkee, is bringing jobs back from overseas, and outlines a series of tax proposals:\nMy message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away.\nThe Democrats like that and get to their feet, and we have that odd state of the union effect where half the audience (Democrats in this case) jumps to their feet and other half (Republicans) sit on their hands and whistle.\n9.26pm: This is a very unusual presidential debate: the moderator hasn't stopped Obama speaking. In fact he appears to be the only candidate on stage.\nNow he's on to international trade – a subject in which Obama has been repeatedly bashed by the Republicans, especially Mitt Romney. Hence this:\nIt's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.\nTonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China.\nSoftware piracy? If only Congress would get an act to stop online piracy ... oh maybe not.\n9.32pm: You may recall from the final season of the West Wing, Matthew Santos's presidential nomination hinged on a deal with the teacher's union over tenure? Well, tonight we have this:\nTeachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.\n9.34pm: Now this is something new: Obama has just proposed that the school leaving age be raised to 18, from the current age of 16:\nSo tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.\nPuzzled applause. I'm not sure the crowd know what to make of it.\n9.39pm: A quick foray into immigration, not enough to actually do anything:\nWe should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.\nIf you had Steve Jobs in a SOTU drinking game, then there you go. Watching from a seat near Michelle Obama is Laurene Powell Jobs.\n9.40pm: So there's one thing that can get everyone on their feet here tonight – oil:\nRight now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right, eight years. Not only that – last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years.\nNaturally, there just happens to be a guest there tonight who got laid off from a furniture factory but is now working for a former luxury yacht maker turned wind turbine manufacturer.\n9.43pm: Very interested strategy being repeated here: Obama keeps saying along the lines of \"I know that political division means we can't have comprehensive reform on tax/immigration/energy policy but can't we at least do [insert modest proposal] ... and send me a bill that creates jobs.\"\nGuardian\n9.46pm: The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill is on the GOP campaign trail but is watching tonight's address from Miami – and sends his thoughts:\nThis seems better than Obama's earlier State of Union speeches. Maybe he is better at campaigning than being in office. All these proposals, from tax reforms to comprehensive immigration reform, sound good. The problem is that he needs Congress to pass them, and that is not going to happen. But a good platform all the same to fight for re-election.\nHaving watched Romney and Gingrich over the last few weeks, Obama is far and away a much better speaker and politician.\n9.51pm: And a brief fire alarm in the office here, that was exciting. Have I missed anything? No, he's still there.\n9.54pm: Obama makes a joke! Talking about regulatory reform, he says:\nWe got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill – because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\nNurse, fetch me a stapler because my sides have split! Obama goes on:\nI'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago.\n9.56pm: Meanwhile, some new efforts to regulate Wall Street, including a new \"Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud\". And after three years, finally this:\nTonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.\nThe Huffington Post's Sam Stein has more background:\nThe office, part of a new Unit on Mortgage Origination and Securitization Abuses, will be chaired by Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, according to a White House official.\nSchneiderman is an increasingly beloved figure among progressives for his criticism of a proposed settlement between the 50 state attorneys generals and the five largest banks. His presence atop this new special unit could give it immediate legitimacy among those who have criticized the president for being too hesitant in going after the banks and resolving the mortgage crisis.\n10pm: Nearly an hour up now – and Obama gets on to Warren Buffett's secretary and how much tax she pays:\nRight now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.\nDo we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else – like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both....\nNow, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.\n10.02pm: So it feels like a rather non-partisan speech – although Republicans may disagree, we'll find that out later – and Obama is now moving into his healer-in-chief mode:\nWe need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas.\nI'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.\nSo far Abraham Lincoln is the only previous president mentioned by name, I'll check.\n10.06pm: Did Obama just call for the end of the filibuster – the need for 60 votes out of 100 to end debate, or cloture – in the Senate? This is what he said:\nA simple majority is no longer enough to get anything – even routine business – passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it.\nInteresting.\n10.08pm: If you had Arab Spring in the drinking game ... well you're still sober, although he has referred to it but not by name.\nBut now it's the two Is: Iran and Israel –\nLet there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.\nand shortly after that:\nOur iron-clad commitment to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history.\n10.11pm: Here's a special feisty section, aimed at the Republican presidential contenders and delivered by Obama with brio:\nFrom the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease, from the blows we've dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example: America is back.\nAnyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about.\nGot that, Romney and Gingrich?\n10.13pm: And just the briefest of mentions of the ending of \"don't ask, don't tell,\" although neatly done:\nWhen you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white, Asian or Latino, conservative or liberal, rich or poor, gay or straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails.\n10.16pm:Strong finish here from Obama, going back to where he started with the example of the military in its unity of purpose, the highpoint being the mission that killed Bin Laden:\nOne of my proudest possessions is the flag that the Seal Team took with them on the mission to get Bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates – a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.\nClever touch. Here's the big finish:\nAll that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves.... More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other – because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back.\nSo it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\nAnd that's it. Well played, I'd say – except that the deification of the military as the role model for a market democracy is uncomfortable. I hesitate to say this but if Republicans came out with those lines, I can guess what the left would accuse them of.\n10.21pm: The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill from a hotel room in Miami:\nThis is one of the most populist speeches I have ever heard. He has just called for curbs on influence of money on politics. Add that to a list that includes comprehensive immigration reforms, supporting clean energy industry, help for mortgage owners, cutting red tape, crack down on financial fraud, including investigation into housing market collapse, help for college students. Almost none of this, maybe none of it, is going to happen soon. But good politics to highlight difference between where he stands and where the Republicans in Congress stand.\n10.24pm: And a tweet that bring together the speech's two themes of Bin Laden and Warren Buffett's secretary:\n— mitrebox (@mitrebox) January 25, 2012\nWe also killed Bin Laden's Secretary. For fairness.\nWell I laughed.\n10.25pm: Hear that noise? It's the sound of a million press releases hitting my inbox. And the winner is ... Charlie Rangel, who must have sent this press release shortly after Obama sat down at his 2011 state of the union address.\n10.30pm: Here's Mitch Daniels. When the cameras go live he appears to be wrestling with a lion while flanked by blonde Amazons ... no he's just a guy with a comb-over in a suit.\nHe's known as a fiscal hawk, and this must be true because Daniels appears to have refused to have turned on any lights for this telecast.\nActually now he's warmed up a bit I can see why Republicans were keen on him running for the presidency: he sounds like he can chew gum and talk at the same time. He's better than Bobby Jindal, that's for sure: Worst. Response. Ever.\n10.39pm: Daniels is still banging on, and has just delivered a fabulously silly metaphor about America going over a Niagra of debt. Or possibly death. Or possibly Viagra of death. Hmm.\nLots of people taking the mickey out of Mitch Daniels on Twitter – elite liberal social media – but he seems sane compared with the shouty madness of Romney, Santorum and Gingrich.\nPaul Begala on CNN, though, says that Daniels's speech was \"like a glass of milk with a fly in it\".\n10.45pm: The Guardian's Suzanne Goldenberg looks at the environmental angles in Obama's address tonight, and inds little to cheer:\nGuardian\nThe word \"Keystone\" did not cross Obama's lips – even though he is getting hammered by Republicans for his decision last week to reject an expansion of the controversial pipeline to pump Alberta crude across six American states to refineries on the Texas coast.\nThe other big unmentionable was Solyndra, the solar company that was first in line for an Obama clean energy loan – and then went bankrupt last year.\nBoth topics are now staples for Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich's stump speeches.\nObama did, indirectly, acknowledge Solyndra, saying: \"Some technologies don't pan out, some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.\"\nThere was only one mention of climate change – which is one more than last year's state of the union. But it was in a line in which Obama said there was little chance of Congress passing climate change legislation.\nOn the other energy and environment issues, it was not immediately clear whether Obama was speaking retrospectively. He talked about opening up more areas for offshore drilling – although he did that in 2011.\nHe said he would require oil and gas companies to disclose what chemicals they use in the controversial process known as fracking – even though most states already require such disclosures.\nObama also mentioned expanding clean energy projects – such as giant solar farms – on public lands, generating enough electricity for 3m homes a year. The department of energy approved 18 such projects by the end of last year that, by conservative estimates, would power at least that many homes.\n10.50pm: Hey it's Michele Bachmann on Fox News! I'd forgotten she existed.\nGreta Van Susteren foolishly persists in asking Bachmann sensible questions but now Bachmann isn't running for president so she doesn't even have to pretend to be sane.\nApparently Herman Cain is giving a Tea Party response to the state of the union but I can't find it anywhere.\n10.58pm: According to Twitter's government team – wait, Twitter has a government unit? – peak tweets per minute during the SOTU came after the \"spilled milk\" line: 14,131 TPM at 9:51pm ET.\nSee, jokes work.\n11.02pm: Ha, I have just noticed that here in Washington DC, \"Bobby Jindal\" is trending on Twitter.\n— John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) January 25, 2012\nThis was the finest #RepublicanResponse since the hilarious network premiere of 'Bobby Jindal, Boy Governor.'\nThat's how bad his 2010 state of the union response was. Every year it reminds people to find it.\n11.14pm: Josh Barro, an economist at the Manhattan Institute, has been live blogging the state of the union address, and he is disappointed with what wasn't mentioned by Obama:\nAs I feared, the speech contained no discussion of monetary policy whatsoever. There was a housing proposal designed to help underwater homeowners, but it's not very good. Very strangely, the President did not call on Congress to extend the 99-week Unemployment Insurance program that is set to expire on February 29. Is the White House preparing to back down on UI? Or did they just not think it was important enough to mention in the speech?\nBut Barro doesn't think much of Mitch Daniels's reply either:\nI don't like this speech, either. The big problem is similar to Obama's speech: no proposals to improve monetary policy or housing policy. Additionally, he drastically overstates the risks created by fiscal deficits. A fiscal adjustment is needed, but not immediately, and it is not job one. We do not have \"a short grace period\" before falling into a Greek-style fiscal hole – we have a long grace period.\nHe's right about the housing market, which remains the single biggest dead weight on the US economy.\n11.21pm: Mitt Romney pops up on telly. And guess what? He didn't like Obama's speech:\nWhat he says and what he does are so dramatically different. Where was he during his first two years? Why didn't he get these things done during his first two years?\nBecause he was too busy passing Massachusetts's healthcare into federal law?\n11.37pm: The Republican National Committee has been hard at work since the speech ended, putting together this nifty attack.\nIt cleverly compares lines of rhetoric from tonight's speech with the state of the union addresses in 2011 and 2010. Not damning perhaps, but for an American political attack ad, quite subtle.\n11.45am: For some reason I spent time looking for Herman Cain's response but I don't know why I bothered: he hasn't been suddenly endowed with wisdom since dropping out of the Republican presidential race.\nSo there we had a speech from President Obama that was in may ways a good one, because Obama steered clear of some of usual rhetorical flourishes, such as praising himself, and avoided blaming everything on the Republicans, which was much of the 2011 state of the union. Instead it was, although long, quite a lean speech, sticking to familiar lines. He particularly avoided more contentious areas of policy, such as healthcare.\nThe one interesting area was on education, specifically proposals to shake up teachers and to extend the compulsory schooling age to 18. But the details remain to be seen, and until then there's not much else to say.\nSimilarly, some interesting sounding ideas on financial malpractice that feel at least two years two late, and a still-to-be-announced plan on helping homeowners re-finance their mortgages. But nothing root and branch, which the housing market would require.\nThen again, Obama knows that little of legislative worth can be done given the current state of politics in Washington and the shrinking envelope of possibilities before the general election swallows everything up.\nAnd as for the election: based on tonight's address, the White House still thinks that Mitt Romney is the most likely candidate to be facing Obama in the fall. The New York Times is spot on with this reading:\nWhen Mr Obama talked about levying a millionaires tax, he might have been referring to Mr Romney's newly released tax return, which disclosed he paid a tax rate of 13.9% on income of more than $20m in 2010.\nWhen he referred to his administration's bailout of the auto industry, noting that \"some even said we should let it die,\" he could have been talking about Mr Romney's argument that the carmakers should have been allowed to fail.\nAnd so on.",

        "conteudo": "Congressional negotiators have reached agreement on a compromise spending bill to avert a weekend federal shutdown. They have also worked toward a deal renewing the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for another year, but prepared a shorter version as a fallback.\nThe Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, told reporters he was still optimistic that bipartisan talks on year-long extensions of the social security payroll tax cut and unemployment coverage would succeed. But as a plan B, he said, they were working on a two-month extension as well, which would also prevent cuts in Medicare reimbursements for doctors during that period.\n\"We're still working on the long-term,\" bill, Reid told reporters as he left the Capitol on Thursday after a day of talks over both the payroll tax and spending measures. As for the two-month version, he said, \"We'll only do that if what we're working on doesn't work out.\"\nReid's remarks put a slight damper on a day on which, for the first time, Democratic and Republican leaders expressed optimism at prospects for swift compromise on their payroll tax standoff and a spending battle that had threatened to shutter federal agencies beginning at midnight on Friday.\nA deal on a $1tn (£644,000bn) spending bill was reached after Republicans agreed to drop language that would have blocked President Obama's liberalised rules on people who visit and send money to relatives in Cuba. But a GOP provision will stay in the bill thwarting an Obama administration rule on energy efficiency standards that critics argued would make it hard for people to purchase inexpensive incandescent light bulbs.\nThe House is expected to approve the spending measure on Friday, and the Senate could follow suit, possibly the same day.\nDonald Stewart, spokesman for the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said talks aimed at agreeing to a year-long extension of the payroll tax measure will continue.\n\"We're 12 hours into this debate, they just started talking,\" he said when asked about the two-month version of the bill. \"I wouldn't hit the panic button.\"\nA senior White House official said the administration supported the two-month plan.\nBargainers were considering the two-month extension of this year's payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits bill because, so far, they haven't agreed how a year-long extension would be paid for, said a Democratic aide.\nThe two-month bill would cost $40bm, according to the aide. It would be paid for from a list of around $120bn in savings that bargainers are considering, including sales of the broadcast spectrum and raising fees that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge to back mortgages, the aide said.\nThe two-month extension would let lawmakers revisit the measure after returning to Washington after the holiday season. That could be risky because that work would come well into the 2012 presidential and congressional election year.\nWithout congressional action, the payroll taxes would rise and extra benefits for the long-term unemployed would expire on 1 January. Doctors' Medicare payments would be automatically reduced that day by 27%, a reduction that could prompt some to stop seeing Medicare patients.\n\"Right now, Congress needs to make sure that 160 million working Americans don't see their taxes go up on 1 January,\" said Obama, referring to the tax cut extension at the core of the jobs programme he outlined in a nationally televised speech three months ago.\nHouse speaker John Boehner of Ohio, the most powerful Republican in an era of divided government, agreed. \"We can extend payroll tax relief for American workers, help create new jobs and keep the government running. And frankly, we can do it in a bipartisan way,\" he said.\nIn the Capitol, the previous day's bristling rhetoric and partisan jabs all but vanished.\nStill another year-end bill, setting new rules for the handling of terror suspects in US custody, won final congressional approval and headed to Obama's desk for his signature.\nRepublicans agreed to consider changes to a $1tn spending bill compromise that they and at least one Democrat said had been wrapped up days ago.\nOn the payroll tax cut bill, Democrats abandoned their demand for a surtax on million-dollar incomes that they wanted to include in the measure.\nAt a news conference, Boehner minimised the concession, noting that Democrats lacked the votes to impose the surtax a year ago when they commanded 60 votes in the Senate. Even so, he said, \"there was some movement yesterday from the White House and Democrat leaders\" toward a compromise.\nBoehner also left open the possibility of a compromise on another key sticking point - a House-passed provision that all but requires construction of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas Gulf Coast refineries.\nConstruction \"will put 20,000 people to work immediately And there are about 115,000 other jobs directly related to it\", he said. Yet he skipped an opportunity to say construction of the project was non-negotiable as talks on the payroll tax cut bill proceeded.\nObama has threatened to veto the House-passed bill, in part citing the requirement for the pipeline. The project has been studied for more than three years, but the president recently announced he would put off a decision until after the 2012 elections.\nAt Obama's insistence, Congress cut the 6.2% social security payroll tax to 4.2% this year in an effort to stimulate the economy with more consumer spending. The president has proposed deepening the cut to 3.1% next year, but Republicans have only shown a willingness to renew it at this year's level.\nObama also wants to leave in place a system that provides aid for up to 99 weeks for the long-term unemployed. The House-passed measure reduces the total by 20 weeks, a step that the administration says would cut off 3.3 million individuals and that Democrats are hoping to soften if not reverse.\nReid indicated that a number of expiring tax breaks were on the table, as well, a list that included a provision that benefits commuters who use mass transit.\nThe House-passed payroll tax cut measure relied on a pay freeze and increased pension contributions for federal workers, as well as higher Medicare premiums for seniors with incomes over $80,000, beginning in 2017. The bill would also raise a fee that is charged to banks whose mortgages are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and cancel more than $40bn from the year-old healthcare bill, Obama's signature domestic achievement.\nThe year-end, $1tn spending measure would lock in cuts that Republicans extracted from Democrats in negotiations conducted months ago against the deadline of a previous government shutdown threat. It funds 10 Cabinet departments, including the Pentagon and dozens of smaller agencies, awarding a slight increase to the military and veterans' programmes while trimming most other domestic programmes.\nThe separate defence bill covered military personnel, weapons systems, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and more at a cost of $662bn, $27bn below Obama's request. The Senate approved it by a resounding 86-13.\nThe main controversy revolved around a provision to require military custody for foreign terrorist suspects linked to al-Qaida or its affiliates and involved in plotting or attacking the US. Under a change made to gain Obama's backing, the legislation would permit the FBI to arrest and interrogate foreign terror suspects, as is now the case.",

One that he produced for the Guardian website's Genius slot was so complex that, when he came to checking the proof, he said that he would be surprised if anyone would be able to solve it, because he certainly couldn't.\nBut, unlike some setters, he was clear that, in the running battle of wits between the setter and the solver, the purpose of the game was that the solver should win; that the point of the show was that solvers should feel bright for having cracked the code and not dim for being unable to work out how a clue worked, even when they had the solution in front of them. Above all, whether they filled in the whole puzzle correctly, or solved just a handful of clues by the end of the day, it was only worthwhile if they had some fun on the way.\nRev John Graham, AKA Araucaria. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian David Sillitoe for the Go 'way ir you sub a fashion blogGuardian\nHe never dumbed down in the process. Once I did ask him whether a solution to a clue was quite fair to today's Guardian solvers, as it depended on knowing that the activities of bands of Welshmen dressed as women, protesting violently against the effects of high road tolls in South Wales between 1842 and 1844, are called collectively the Rebecca Riots. His kindly reply was that, provided the clue fairly led to the solution, what was wrong with Guardian readers being led to discover facts about a 19th-century radical uprising of which they might otherwise have been unaware.\nAraucaria pretty much kept away from the deliberately misleading punctuations and spellings that younger setters are now using in their clues quite freely, though he came to accept that words such as \"indeed\" or \"instead\", for example, could fairly indicate that a solution was constructed as DEED or STEAD. But his capacity to engage professionally and socially with people of all ages and the way in which he took without difficulty in his late 70s and 80s to the internet and the world of Google meant that his puzzles seemed to move smoothly with the developments of the modern world.\nUntil right at the end his mind was active. His final puzzle for the paper, published on 16 November 2013, was up to the standards of his very best. One clue (15 down) was a classic Araucaria mixture of current political and personal concerns. \"Swap large numbers in protest from Lincolnshire town: no wind farm!\" links nimby protests against renewable energy sources with the town of Louth, which he always wanted to visit and now never will. NIMBY LOUTH (swapping M/1000 for L/50) became NIL BY MOUTH to someone with cancer of the oesophagus in a Cambridge hospital.",

        "conteudo": "The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would have had $1.9bn (£1.3bn) more to spend on its lifesaving health projects if it had divested from fossil fuels and instead invested in greener companies, according to a new analysis.\nThe Canadian research company Corporate Knights examined the stock holdings of 14 funds, worth a combined $1tn, and calculated how they would have performed if they had dumped shares in oil, coal and gas companies three years ago.\nOverall, the funds would have been $23bn better off with fossil fuel divestment. The Wellcome Trust, which is the world’s biggest health charity after the Gates Foundation, would have been $353m better off. The huge Dutch pension fund ABP would have had $9bn in higher returns, while Canada’s CPP would have had $7bn more.\nCampaign sign up\n“There are billions of dollars potentially being left on the table by these large funds as a result of hanging on to fossil fuel stocks and being underexposed to the $3tn [environmental] sector,” said Toby Heaps, chief executive of Corporate Knights. Separately, a fossil free index from one of the world’s largest providers of financial indexes, MSCI, has just completed its first year with returns 60% greater than its parent index.\nThe Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust are widely recognised for their important work and have been the focus of a Guardian campaign asking them to divest their large endowments from fossil fuels.\nClimate change poses the greatest threat to health in the 21st century, according to doctors, and to avoid catastrophic impacts, most known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. If the world’s governments keep their word and halt global warming, those reserves could become worthless, meaning there are both financial and moral arguments for divestment. Investors managing over $2.6tn of assets have already committed to divestment, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest. The Bank of England has also warned of potentially huge losses.\n“The number one complaint about divestment we’ve heard from fund managers is that it would cost them too much money,” said Jamie Henn, communications director at 350.org, the climate campaign that commissioned the new research. “As it turns out, they are dead wrong. The energy industry of the 21st century is going to look nothing like the fossil fuel industry of the 20th. Institutions that don’t change with the times stand to lose big and, as this new analysis shows, they already are.” 350.org are partners on the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign.\nThe Corporate Knights research examined how 14 large investment funds would have performed if they had divested from fossil fuels in October 2012. The fossil fuel firms excluded were the top 100 coal companies and top 100 oil and gas companies, ranked by the size of their reserves by Fossil Free Indices, plus utilities generating more than 30% of their power by burning coal, as ranked by South Pole Group.\nIn the analysis, the excluded investments were replaced by increased investments in green companies already held by the funds. Green companies were those getting more than 20% of their revenue from environmental solutions as verified by FTSE Environmental Markets or Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a pool of 1,600 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $3tn.\nThe analysis found the New York City Employee Retirement scheme would have been $1.6bn better off with divestment, as would Australia’s Future Fund.\n“The period of analysis coincides with a tough market for oil and commodities in general,” said Heaps. “Over the next few years, many oil stocks – if not coal utilities – could jump back, but in the long term, I don’t think a lot of prudent market watchers are betting that the carbon intensive sectors are going to outperform the market in general.” A crunch UN climate summit begins in Paris in two weeks, at which governments are expected to agree a deal to significantly cut future carbon emissions.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust does not comment on its investment holdings and decisions. Bill Gates has called fossil fuel divestment a “false solution” and in June announced he would invest $2bn of his own fortune in innovative renewable energy projects over five years.\nA spokeswoman for the Wellcome Trust said: “The Trust’s long-term investment strategy has led to a total return of over £9bn since September 2008, while returns over both 10 and 20 years up to September 2014 have averaged above 10% per year in nominal terms.” This would allow charitable spending of £1bn a year for the next five years, she said. The director of the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar, said on Sunday that the impacts of climate change on health “affect us today, never mind affecting our children or our grandchildren. This is not some abstract threat; it is immediate and it is personal.”\nThe MSCI fossil fuel free index replicates its broad All Country World Index (ACWI), but without 124 companies identified as having large reserves of coal, oil and gas. In its first year, to October 2015, the fossil free index produced gross returns of 6.5% compared to 4.1% for the ACWI.\nThe significant outperformance of the fossil free index reflected the troubled year suffered by energy companies, said Tom Kuh, head of ESG indexes for MSCI: “The challenge for investors is to figure out whether what is going on with energy is cyclical or structural.”\nKuh noted the upcoming UN climate summit, the coal industry’s troubles of the last five years and recent legal investigations in the US into ExxonMobil and said: “There seems to be more pressure coming from regulators and policymakers on fossil fuel companies because of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.”\nHe said demand for fossil free and low carbon indexes was growing and that the fossil fuel divestment campaign had brought the issue to prominence in the last two years. MSCI will also be providing carbon footprints for all 160,000 of its indexes in 2016. “Carbon is increasingly becoming a factor that investors are looking at in understanding risk in their portfolios,” Kuh said.\nFossil fuel ticker",

        "conteudo": "China is braced for a wave of industrial bankruptcies as its slowing economy forces companies with sky-high debts to the wall, the country's premier has said.\nPremier Li Keqiang told lenders to China's private sector factories they should expect debt defaults as the world's second largest economy encounters \"serious challenges\" in the year ahead.\nSpeaking after the annual session of the national people's congress, Li Keqiang said: \"We are going to confront serious challenges this year and some challenges may be even more complex.\" He told lenders to China's private sector factories they should expect debt defaults.\nLi said China must \"ensure steady growth, ensure employment, avert inflation and defuse risks\" while also fighting pollution, among other tasks.\n\"So we need to strike a proper balance amidst all these goals and objectives,\" he added. \"This is not going to be easy,\" he said.\nLi's warning followed the failure of Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy to make a payment on a 1bn yuan (£118m) bond last week. The default was the first of its kind for China and widely seen as pointing to the end of 11th-hour government bailouts for troubled enterprises.\nSome analysts said the decision to let some indebted firms collapse was a sign the authorities had learned from the Japanese boom and bust experience of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Tokyo was plunged into two \"lost\" decades of stagnation after it prevented zombie companies from declaring bankruptcy – even blocking petitions from bondholders in the courts - when a property collapse exposed debts many times the value of their businesses.\nHowever, figures this week revealed that Beijing is copying the Japanese tactic of ramping up public infrastructure spending to replace the steep slowdown in private sector investment. Fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, expanded 17.9% during the first two months of 2014, the National Bureau of Statistics said.\nChina's industrial production rose at its slowest pace in five years with surveys showing a faster slowdown than expected. Industrial output, which measures production at factories, workshops and mines, rose 8.6% in January and February year on year, which is the lowest pace of growth since the 7.3% annual growth figure recorded in April 2009.\nThe figures covered a two-month period owing to China's lunar new year holiday week, which fell in both months.\nRetail sales gained 11.8% in the two months from the year before, the lowest since an 11.6% increase in February 2011.\nThe pessimistic data surprised economists but followed indicators for manufacturing, trade and inflation that also suggested weakness in China's economy.\nChina's GDP grew 7.7% in 2013, unchanged from the year before, the slowest growth since 1999. Li said this month that Beijing was targeting economic growth of about 7.5% in 2014, the same target as last year.\nSociété Générale said in a research note that the results were a confirmation of \"fast deterioration of China's economic growth\". But Julian Evans-Pritchard, Asia economist for Capital Economics, said officials were unlikely to intervene.\n\"Limited and seasonally distorted data over the last few weeks have made it difficult to make sense of what's really happening in China's economy,\" he said in a note. \"Despite this broad evidence of a slowdown, we don't think policymakers will necessarily step in to support growth,\" he said, adding that officials were \"comfortable with a moderate slowdown\".\nThe figures come as China's leadership says it wants to transform the growth model away from an over-reliance on often wasteful investment, making private demand the driver for the country's development.\nA reliance on public sector investment while the private sector rebalances away from low margin manufacturing relies for its success on the economy maintaining the government's growth target.\nLi said: \"Last year, without taking any additional short-term stimulus measures, we succeeded in meeting our target. Why can't we do this this year?\"\nHe emphasised the target was approximate. \"This 'about' shows that there is a level of flexibility here.\"\nAt any rate, he said authorities were not focused on the figure itself, but how it contributes to improving livelihoods, saying growth \"needs to ensure fairly full employment and needs to help increase people's income\".",

Given the boost to low-carbon electricity, to energy security and to jobs, the Chinese interest in taking forward investment at Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation – is hugely welcome.\nBut equally important is that both China and the UK recognise that climate change is one of the greatest global challenges we face. For the first time ever, the UK and China have released a joint statement, committing our governments to work even more closely together on a response to climate change.\nIt’s important because it is only the second time China has done this. The only other country with which China has agreed a statement on climate change is the US. This statement reflects the strength of our cooperation with China on climate change and low carbon.\nThe science tells us that urgent action is needed. The recent flooding in the UK is testament to the devastation that climate change could bring to our daily lives. Climate change is putting pressures on the resources we need to survive: water; agricultural land; food. To combat this, we are investing in low carbon and energy efficiency technologies, with an increased focus on homegrown renewables, to reduce our reliance of foreign imports and create a sustainable supply of affordable energy for consumers and businesses alike. But Britain cannot solve climate change alone.\nIt is well known that China is now the world’s biggest emitter. But when I visited China last year I saw for myself the extraordinary effort being made to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and to curb air pollution. China is taking rapid action to reduce dependence on coal. Coal is now around 65% of the energy mix compared to 70% in 2010 and massive investment in clean energy and in energy efficiency is underway.\nTwo weeks ago the US president, Barack Obama, announced new plans to regulate carbon from power plants. This means the world’s two largest emitters are now taking aggressive action to avoid dangerous climate change. The low-carbon progress in China deserves greater recognition. As well as being the biggest emitter, China is also the world’s largest investor in the global clean energy transition.\nPeople are quick to be cynical about international efforts to limit global warming but the fact of the matter is that there is no other option but to agree an ambitious deal in Paris next year.\nBritain is working with like-minded European countries and pushing for an ambitious EU energy and climate change package that will lead to a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and will take us on the next step to tackling climate change. This will help promote the long-term investment we need to drive down the cost of clean technologies. A credible and effective response to climate change - which protects future generations from an unacceptable level of risk - needs the involvement of all countries.\nWe have been developing an ever closer relationship with China on climate change for many years which has led to collaboration on carbon trading, offshore wind development, on low-carbon buildings, on nuclear energy, and on carbon capture and storage – to name just some of the ways in which we’re working together.\nThe UK and China are obvious partners in this challenge. Our strengths lie in bringing together UK’s broad science base and our experience, with China’s enormous scale and ability to innovate low-cost solutions. By working together, we can turn the tide of climate change and protect future generations.",

        "conteudo": "China has ordered more than 2,000 highly polluting, unsafe or energy inefficient plants to shut down within two months, state media reported today.\nEnvironmental campaigners welcomed the measure, saying the announcement went well beyond previous orders in naming specific facilities and outlining stiff penalties for firms that do not comply by the end of September.\nThe notice from the ministry of industry and information technology covers 18 industries including steel, paper, cement and dyeing, according to Shanghai Securities News and other media. It includes companies across the country and will affect parts of the Aluminium Corporation of China, better known as Chalco, and Hebei Iron and Steel Group, the country's biggest steelmaker.\n\"There is no doubt this announcement is significant, especially because it is complete with real consequences; if they don't meet the target they will be barred from obtaining loans, for example,\" said Alex Wang, of the Natural Resources Defence Council.\nOther penalties include having sewage treatment licences revoked or being refused business licences.\nBeijing's target is to reduce energy intensity – the amount used to generate each unit of gross domestic product – by 20% from the 2005 level.\nIt improved by 14.4% in the first four years of the plan, putting it in touching distance of its pledge.\nBut in May premier Wen Jiabao said he would use an \"iron hand\" to increase energy efficiency after figures showed it had deteriorated by 3.6% in the first quarter. That probably reflected the effect of the economic recovery and a stimulus package that included large amounts of spending on resource-hungry infrastructure.\nImprovements in the second quarter smoothed out the effects of the drop, with efficiency falling by 0.09% over the first half of the year compared with the same period of 2009.\nAccording to the World Bank, Chinese industries use 20% to 100% more energy per unit of output than their US, Japanese and other counterparts. The government is keen to improve efficiency in part because of the environmental impact but also because of its concerns about energy security.\n\"[This announcement] shows how these five year plan targets can really mobilise behaviour … people's career prospects are riding on meeting them,\" added Wang. But he cautioned: \"As with all things in China, what will be critical is how they implement this. To what extent have they been able to identify all the outdated equipment out there – have companies managed to hide some of it from the government?\"\nYang Ailun of Greenpeace said: \"The Chinese government have a 20% intensity target and were really struggling to implement it. Given that there's only half a year left, they really have to take more dramatic measures to meet it. The only kind of policies that can work within a very short time are shutdowns.\"\nShe added: \"I think if they have actually announced it and named companies, for sure it's going to happen. In the longer term, to shut down the most energy inefficient facilities doesn't just make environmental sense but also economic sense.\"\nShe said the new document in part reflected the fact the government now had a clearer plan for achieving its target and better information, but also showed the difficulties of implementing central directives.\n\"It tells us that it is not enough sometimes for the government to say 'This is how much your province or company needs to achieve' … [giving] very specific names of things they want to close down makes it easier for them to check whether implementation is there. It also encourages other parties, such as the public and environmental NGOs, to help check.\"\nThe list included 762 cement factories, 279 paper mills, 175 steel mills, 192 coking plants and an unspecified number of aluminum mills. Henan province in central China and Shaanxi in the north each have more than 200 of the \"backward\" facilities.\nChina has overtaken the United States as the world's biggest consumer of energy, the International Energy Agency reported last month.",

        "conteudo": "Declarations of love do not get much more highly charged than the one Zhao Xiuxia received from her husband recently on an LED screen bigger than a football pitch.\n\"Dear wife, I adore you. You work so hard for our family. Let's struggle together for a better life,\" scrolled the giant letters on an electronic ceiling above one of Beijing's glitziest new shopping centres.\nAs well as being a message of devotion, the mobile phone text message – magnified by 5m pixels – highlights the dramatic increase in the wattage of China's economy.\nThe giant 250 metre-long screen at The Place retail centre is one of the most conspicuous symbols of an increasingly affluent and energy-hungry nation, which was said last week to have overtaken the United States as the biggest consumer of energy in the world.\nAccording to the respected International Energy Agency, China's use of coal, oil, wind and other sources of power more than doubled in the past decade to reach the equivalent of 2.26bn tonnes of oil in 2009, creeping past the US total of 2.17bn tonnes (see graphic below).\nThis is a major turning point. Energy use is closely related to carbon dioxide emissions, economic expansion and the global balance of power. The US has been the world's biggest energy user since records began.\nThe Chinese government has challenged the figure, but the trend is unmistakable. While most developed nations suffered flat or negative economic – and energy – growth last year, China's GDP rose by 8.7%, putting it on course to soon overtake Japan as the world's second biggest economy, and its emissions – already the highest of any nation – increased 9%, while those of most industrialised nations fell.\nThe bulk of China's energy demand comes from industry and infrastructure, but individual consumption is also rising, albeit from a low base.\nChina has a great deal of ground to make up before it can provide its 1.3bn citizens with a lifestyle comparable to those in the US or Europe. But its people are plugging in more air conditioners, microwave ovens, TV sets and computers than ever before. They are also driving more vehicles. Last year, China surpassed the US as the country that sold the most new cars.\nCityscapes are being transformed. Several Beijing skyscrapers have transformed themselves into 30- and 40-storey LED screens in the wake of the ancient capital's Olympic makeover into a super-modern urban metropolis.\nThe Place, which boasts the biggest single screen display in Asia, is among the most eye-catching and energy intensive. Modelled on a still-bigger screen in Las Vegas and designed by Emmy-winning Hollywood designer Jeremy Railton, it intersperses custom-made films about the stars, undersea creatures and famous landscapes with personal messages, which can cost as little as 1 yuan for a single text message or 20,000 yuan (£1,850) for a dedicated marriage proposal video (more than one suitor has gone on his knees before his girlfriend, while the screen above shows photographs of the couple).\nSuch ostentation is the exception rather than the norm in China, where the average person's energy use is still only a quarter that in the US.\nZhao Xiuxia received her husband's giant love message while working as a waitress at a nearby juice bar – one of two jobs that together give her a 14-hour working day and a monthly income of just 3,000 yuan (£300) a month.\nAlong with her husband's salary, this allows the couple – who have recently migrated from a poor farming village in the Hebei countryside – to afford a computer, freezer, air conditioner and motorbike. Their parents have none of these commodities.\n\"My village is still very dark. We only turn on the road lamps once or twice a year at festival times,\" Zhao said, contrasting this with her current place of work. \"When I first saw the giant screen at The Place, I was astonished. It was so big and beautiful.\"\nThis man-made beauty has an environmental cost. According to the management company, the screen consumes about 1,500 kW , around 150,000 times that of a 10-watt energy-saving bulb.\nThe government is trying to reduce the impact of this and similar expansions by promoting renewable energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal power.\nLast week, the state media said China would spend about 5 trillion yuan on clean energy in the next decade and reduce its dependency on coal from 70% to 63% by 2015. Domestic scientists also claimed a breakthrough in the development of a new generation of nuclear power plants.\n\"They are doing everything they can to increase the supply of energy,\" said Paul French, coauthor of a book about China's growing impact on oil shipping routes. \"They are building nuclear plants, making photovoltaic panels like you can't imagine. Same for wind, hydro and biomass ... The trend is that they will continue to consume more energy.\"\nThe impact on global markets is increasingly apparent. China's dependency on imported oil reached 50% for the first time last year and is forecast to rise to 75% by 2030. In recent years, it has also become a major importer of coal from Australia and its nuclear power plans have helped to push the price of uranium to unprecedented highs.\n\"When China sneezes, the whole world panics,\" said Wu Changhua, China director of The Climate Group. \"There are contradictory attitudes about China's rise in international society. On one hand, people want China to boost the global economy. On the other, they hope China will not emit too much greenhouse gas. Decision-makers here have a clear idea that they want to pioneer a new path away from the current dangerous model of development. But it is unprecedented in human history for a nation to deal with this challenge, while coping with a huge population and relatively little land and resources.\"\nThe shift to a low-carbon economy is still a work in progress. Across the road from The Place, a new shopping mall is being constructed that aims to pioneer a shift to greener values. Parkview Green, a triangular structure of steel and glass with triple-glazed windows, claims to set a new standard for energy efficiency in Beijing.\nA spokesman for the project said state-of-the-art technology, materials and design would save a fortune on heating and cooling.\n\"Our building can actually breathe,\" said Leo Hwang, the executive director of Parkview Green. \"We need to understand what we get from the environment and what we need to give back. We need to try to find the balance. Some buildings consume a lot of energy and resources. We hope to use them better.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether the new shopping mall is any more successful in promoting greener, energy-efficient values than its neighbour, The Place.\n• Additional reporting by Cui Zheng\n• To order Jonathan Watt's book, When a Billion Chinese Jump, for £9.99 (rrp £14.99) call 0330 333 6846 or visit guardianbookshop.co.uk.\nGraphic\n• This article was amended on 4 August 2010.

        "conteudo": "I am beginning to feel anxious for my city. Not only are there some glaring holes in Plan Melbourne – the state government’s strategic plan for the city to the year 2050 – but we are now seeing the results of scant attention to the content, administration and enforcement of our local planning controls. The result? Blots on our cityscape which will haunt us for decades.\nMelbourne’s population is expected to double within the next 40 years. With care, we can absorb that growth and maintain our highly valued liveability. But unless we return to using the planning system to respect what makes us distinctive and to insist, among other things, on good design standards for new development, we are putting our city at risk.\nThe community is sceptical about planning controls. It is completely shut out of some major decision making. Planning controls can verge on meaningless. “Discretionary”, or indicative, controls pervade the system. Discretionary height controls, for example, provide no real clue as to what might be approved – witness buildings 200 or more metres high on City Road in South Melbourne. The height controls in the planning scheme there are half that figure.\nThese increased heights are often argued on the basis of the exemplary energy efficiency of a proposed building – farcical when air conditioning units then take up valuable space on every balcony – or good architecture.\nToo often, multiple modifications made to proposals after their initial approval erode the original design quality. The first application will be to secure a particular height or density, for example, and the subsequent modifications to reduce building costs.\nDiscretionary controls can be problematic for developers as well as the wider community. Appeals to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Vcat) create increased holding costs and uncertainty about a final outcome. This is a senseless drain on our city’s productivity.\nMore honest or definitive controls present an opportunity to secure community benefits. Gone are the development bonus systems which set a baseline of allowable development, such as a total amount of floor space, and then a fixed additional amount of development in exchange for features with genuine community benefit.\nMany fine pedestrian walkways and arcades built in the central business district in the 1980s and 1990s were achieved this way, as was the restoration of heritage buildings. Visiting overseas experts are usually startled that we have no clear, transparent bargaining tools in our planning schemes to secure, for instance, an affordable housing component in major developments.\nMuch has been said about the “two Melbournes” – the inner areas rich in services and the outer areas where hardship for residents is entrenched by the failure to address the lack of public transport and local employment. In between the two is a third Melbourne: the middle suburbs, with a reasonable planning legacy but ready for upgrading in many places.\nWe must create greater opportunity and choice in outer areas. The growth-area councils know exactly what needs to be done to avoid perpetuating pockets of disadvantage. They need greater state government support for their proposals to ensure communities are better served.\nWe need to reopen the debate about the potential densification of the middle suburbs that was shut down with the introduction of new residential zones. These suburbs include areas with solid foundations for more growth. Provided they have a real say and full information, communities can understand the options and trade-offs involved with greater densities.\nBut we are now also putting inner areas at risk. Why the rush to quantity, not quality, of development? Why have we lost the courage to insist on maintaining the design quality of our city? Our strong, creative community is still generating some great buildings and public places, but we need a more widespread insistence on design quality. You might be able to mask a poor two-storey building with judicious planting, but nothing can hide an ugly high-rise.\nLet’s try three circuit breakers:\nMake a handful of changes to planning schemes, which could inject greater certainty for all players, offer development bonuses for great place making and other community benefits and ensure that good planning is synonymous with good design\nHarness the wisdom of the community and local councils by including representatives of the five local government metro sub-regions on the board of the new Metropolitan Planning Authority which has been set up by the government to implement Plan Melbourne\nFinally, it’s time for the minister for planning to hand back full planning powers to the City of Melbourne. Responsibility was taken away in the 1980s when the council’s planning controls were in a parlous state. Its planning, design and research staff are now arguably the finest in the country and very good decision making can be expected. The arguments for sweeping ministerial powers evaporated some years ago\nCurrent trends are setting us on a path to being “Anywhere City”, not “Distinctive Melbourne”. Let’s make some changes. It’s not too late to act.\nChris Gallagher is a town planner and former chair of the Heritage Council of Victoria. He has served on numerous state government town planning advisory bodies.",

        "conteudo": "Good morning, and welcome to Wednesday and politics live. When our deputy political editor, Katharine Murphy, closed this blog off yesterday evening she left us with the latest Essential poll results, which found the Coalition just ahead of Labor on the two-party-preferred measure, 51% to 49%.\nMalcolm Turnbull’s approval rating is still ahead as preferred prime minister at 40%, though this is down 3%. It’s still a close race and I’m sure there’ll be poll pondering and responses to it this morning.\nPerhaps more importantly, the poll also gave us insight into which leader Australians would most trust to look after their pet.\n— Joanna Mather (@JoannaMather) May 31, 2016\nGuess which leader people would most trust to look after their pet? Hint: he likes unions #Essential Poll #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/A4rmSwGHqV\nBut enough about yesterday’s polls and on to today. Melissa Davey with you here, taking you through until 8.30am, before Murph takes the reins.\nThe big picture\nThe prime minister has jumped to the deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop’s defence after her train-wreck interview with Neil Mitchell yesterday. The usually well-informed, cool and collected Bishop struggled while facing questioning about the government’s superannuation policy.\nNeil asked her: How does the transition to retirement scheme work?\nWell Neil, this is obviously a gotcha moment, you want me to go through … it’s not my portfolio and –\nMitchell: “No, no. This is the hole in your whole logic. You’re saying it’s only 4% of taxpayers. You, Josh Frydenberg, neither of you understand the transition to retirement. That’s clear and this is where you’re hitting average people. Not the fat cats, the average people.”\nBut asked about Bishop’s less-than-convincing answers about a topic which was, to be fair, outside of her portfolio, Turnbull said superannuation was a “notoriously complex” topic:\nBut I’d say this to you — it’s not very complex to know whether you own a $2.3m negatively geared house, most people can work that out.”\nThat was, of course, a stab at the embattled Labor MP David Feeney, who failed to declare one of his properties.\nBut Labor’s spokesman for financial services and superannuation, Jim Chalmers, said Bishop’s failure to adequately answer raised questions about the policy. He told the ABC:\nThe government likes to pretend thats it’s only a very small proportion of people at the top who have been affected, but the evidence we’ve received is that people on various incomes are impacted by that change.”\nAnd the former chief of staff to Tony Abbott, Peta Credlin, who had a frosty relationship with Bishop, also weighed in, accusing the government of failing to explain its policy. She told Sky News viewers:\nThe government, if it’s got a policy, has got to defend it or it has to fix it. It can’t be in this limbo land where it’s not able to explain it. It is going to bite the Coalition if it is not able to deal with it properly.”\nMeanwhile, News Corp Australia reports that the Queensland senator Glenn Lazarus copied his party’s central document from Senator Nick Xenophon, lifting his political rival’s constitution almost verbatim. The pair are fighting for one of the state’s Senate seats.\nNews reports:\nThe copy-and-paste job of the constitution, which sets out what the party stands for and how it is run, includes some typos which have been carried across.\nOne of the only noticeable differences in the 22-page document is replacing the words “Nick Xenophon Team” with “Glenn Lazarus Team” and “South Australia” with “Queensland” throughout.\nBut even the lifting of the document is imperfect, with one section on “delegates” leaping straight into unrelated dot points. It seems a portion of the original has been missed out.\nThe Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) is running two Senate candidates in Queensland.\nSenator Lazarus said a number of the micro parties, including the Jacqui Lambie Network, had developed their constitutions together, working with Senator Xenophon.”\nFinally, an Australian Population Research Institute analysis has cast doubt on Labor’s claims that the Coalition’s plan to freeze the Medicare Benefits Scheme for a further two years until 2020 to save $925m would hit bulk-billing rates.\nThe Australian reported on the findings, writing:\nA growing glut of doctors has forced GPs to “chase patients” and pushed bulk-billing rates to record highs, leaving Medicare vulnerable to overuse that will add to its projected cost blowout of more than $35 billion within a decade.\nGrowth in GP numbers of ­almost 50 per cent over the past decade — 2.5 times population growth — has undermined doctors’ ability to charge fees above the Medicare Benefits Schedule.\n‘There are so many GPs seeking patients that few could risk charging a co-payment because patients would go around the corner to a competitor who bulk bills,’ said report author Bob Birrell. ‘Oversupply is the cause of escalation of GP costs that the Coalition is trying to curtail. But freezing the rebate is just a Band-Aid.’\nMr Birrell called for a lowering of the intake of overseas-trained doctors and new limits on where doctors funded by Medicare were able to practise.”\nOn the campaign trail\nToday Bill Shorten will announce $98.7m towards the creation of up to 10 community power hubs in the areas of most need to deal with the challenges of implementing renewable energy solutions.\nThe hubs will work with local communities to support the development of renewable projects, providing legal and technical expertise and startup funding. Examples of projects that could be eligible include shared arrays of solar panels for groups of renters, known as “solar gardens” and retrofitting of social housing to promote energy efficiency.\nTurnbull will be in Brisbane focusing on innovation. He’ll announce $15m to increase support to Australia’s startup businesses by expanding the incubator support program.\nIt will add to the $8m already allocated to the program to increase the number of startup incubators and accelerators in Australia, support the expansion of existing high-performing incubators and attract “experts in residence’ to provide specialist advice to startup businesses.\nThe campaign you should be watching\nToday, Page will be in focus as the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, campaigns in the seat held by his colleague Kevin Hogan by a margin of 3.1%.\nPage is the scene of a Labor resurgence led by Janelle Saffin, who held the seat from 2007 to 2013. Joyce is facing a similar fight in his electorate of New England with the return of the independent Tony Windsor. He acknowledged this week that the fight for his own seat would be a tough one. But, according to AAP:\nJoyce has rallied supporters – dubbed the ‘killer canaries’ due to their bright yellow T-shirts – to do their best to keep both seats in the hands of the country party.\nThe deputy prime minister conceded while the Nationals may not have the best social media campaign or the ability to nab newspaper front pages, the party did have old-school tricks.\n‘The most powerful thing you ever have in politics is your people,’ Mr Joyce told a group of volunteers in Casino, near Lismore, NSW.\n‘Every one of you knows five, six, seven people – you change votes.’”\nJoyce will make a sports funding announcement in Lismore before travelling to Bundaberg for a street walk and then on to Gympie.\nAnd another thing(s)\nFrom AAP, Senator Nick Xenophon has posed for the men’s magazine GQ Australia, dressed by Target. AAP reports:\nStanding in front of posters emblazoned with ‘make ship happen’ Xenophon’s Target suit would likely be the first of its kind to be photographed for men’s magazine GQ Australia.\nIn a press release Mr Xenophon reveals he refused to be styled by the magazine, sticking to his rigid $100 clothes cap for the shoot which he says includes Lowes shoes and Kmart undies.\nThe June/July issue of the magazine, which has Liam Hemsworth on the cover, features a Q&A with the senator who talks about his dislike of being called a politician and his respect for ‘charming’ prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n‘In state parliament, I had the title The Honourable and after 10 years they told me I could apply to have the title for life, to put it on my letterhead. I loathe that crap,’ he tells the magazine.\nThe magazine will hit newsstands on Monday.”\nBecause it’s been too long since we had some comment on an Abbott comeback ...\nAsked about whether Tony Abbott still has his eye on a comeback, the deputy PM Barnaby Joyce replied:\nHe will want to, but he’ll realise he can’t. To say that he doesn’t have a desire is ridiculous – to say that he can’t overcome that desire by the reality that’s just not going to happen [is another].”\nThi sprompted a scathing response from Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, who did not mince her words on Sky News last night:\nI think that’s absolute rubbish. I was going to say horse shit but I don’t know if I can say that on TV. Honestly, Barnaby, get back on the wombat trail – please leave this alone. Tony’s made absolutely clear that the Abbott years are over, and no one can look at his performance during this campaign and see that he’s anything other than a team player.”\nThe “wombat trail” is a nickname for the Nationals campaign through regional Australia.",

        "conteudo": "Leaked trade industry figures show a five-fold increase in the use of palm oil for biodiesel in Europe between 2010 and 2014, providing new evidence of links between deforestation in southeast Asia and the EU’s renewable energy mandate.\nThe leaked figures, which the Guardian has seen, show that 45% of palm oil used in Europe in 2014 went to biodiesel, up from 8% in 2010.\nGreenhouse gas emissions from biodiesel are more than three times higher than those from conventional diesel engines when indirect effects are considered, according to recent research by the European commission.\nCampaigners say the leaked figures from the Fediol trade association provide further evidence that an EU target for sourcing 10% of Europe’s transport to renewables by 2020 is fuelling global warming.\nJos Dings, the director of green campaign group Transport & Environment (T&E), which published the leak, said: “We now know why the industry is withholding these numbers. They show the ugly truth of Europe’s biofuel policy. It drives tropical deforestation, increases transport emissions, does nothing to help European farmers and does not improve our energy security.”\nT&E calculates that 3.5bn litres of palm oil are now arriving in Europe annually because of a 34% spike in imports for biodiesel since 2010. This would be enough to fill Wembley stadium with biodiesel three times over every day.\n“As if Dieselgate [VW cheating at emissions tests] was not bad enough, we now have a Biodieselgate on top,” Dings said.\nThe vast majority of the world’s palm oil comes from Malaysia and Indonesia. Clearances for palm oil plantations there are thought to be responsible for many of the fires which incinerated an estimated 18.5m hectares of Indonesia’s rainforest between 2001 and 2014.\nIn 2015, the devastation reached record levels, releasing 1.62bn metric tonnes of CO2 and nudging Indonesia above Russia, as the world’s fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\nIf the peatland forests were allowed to regrow, they would resequester much of the released carbon. But conversion of the land for palm oil plantations requires drainage and clearances that release massive amounts of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.\nFediol did not immediately respond to requests for comment but the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) said that the leaked numbers differed from their internal count.\nRaffaello Garofalo, the board’s secretary-general told the Guardian: “The figures we have are substantially lower than that. We would put between 10-15% [of palm oil] globally for biodiesel consumption, based on agricultural sources.”\nThe EBB declined to share its figures for Europe based on palm oil sources, although Garofalo said that biodiesel manufactured that way “can be a little bit more problematic”.\nAn apparent anomaly in the statistics showing a rise in the palm oil composition of Europe’s biodiesel from the lesser figures of 6% to 31% over the same period illustrated that “T&E get their figures from the basket, not from science,” Garofalo said.\nThe use of domestic rapeseed in Europe’s biodiesel blends, general expansion of the biodiesel market, and larger relative volume of biodiesel explain the difference between the two figures, T&E says.\nTim Searchinger, a Princeton University scholar, argued that the leaked numbers were likely too conservative, as palm oil is widely used to displace vegetable oil for use in biodiesel production.\n“The new data confirms the warnings of those who were critical of the EU’s biofuels mandate,” he told the Guardian. “Any pretence that the main consequence of the EU biofuels policy had not been the peat drainage and deforestation of south-east Asia is now unmasked.”\nA European commission spokeswoman declined to comment on the leak. She said: “The commission will present proposals to revise the post-2020 bioenergy framework later this year.”\nThe EU currently has a cap of 7% for first generation biofuels in its 10% mandate. Most of this comes from biodiesel.",

        "conteudo": "Although there are numerous innovative projects seeking to improve the sustainability of Australia’s energy sector, one of the main barriers to making them happen is – as with most things – money.\nWith the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) set to lose $1.3bn in unallocated funds, the agency has announced a raft of grants for green projects, including $17m for nine research and development projects that “have a pathway to being fully commercial” through industry partners.\nRelated: Most voters support transition to 100% renewable energy, says Australia Institute\nAccording to Arena’s CEO Ivor Frischknecht, the three-year projects all focus on integrating either more renewables or more energy into industrial processes or the grid to “help drive down the balance of system costs” while boosting sustainability.\nWe look at four of the multi-partner projects that could potentially make a big difference to greening Australia’s economy.\nIncreasing the uptake of solar photovoltaics in strata developments\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFifty units in the White Gum Valley suburb in Perth will trial strata-owned solar power.\nAccording to Arena, more than two million households have solar power systems on their rooftops but installing and running solar installations on apartments – such as those run by strata agents – has been a harder nut to crack.\nTo tackle the problem, the agency has provided $900,000 to a $2.6m project aimed at producing a governance model for shared solar installations.\n“The key question with installing solar panels on a strata development is how you govern a shared utility like this,” says Prof Greg Morrison of Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, who is leading the project.\n“The answer is that, right now, we don’t fully know how this governance could work, so the research will look at different type of models the developers can use.”\nThe project will involve around 50 units in three developments in Perth’s White Gum Valley suburb and will examine the shared benefits, risks and costs of such a system, as well as any legal implications for dwelling purchases and dwelling leases.\nUsing biogas in sugarcane transport and milling\nAustralia’s $2bn sugar industry may already be largely energy self-sufficient on the processing side, but little is done to utilise the waste sugarcane left over after harvesting.\nAssociate professor Ian O’Hara from Queensland University of Technology’s Centre for Tropical Crops and Biocommodities is leading a $5.7m project (with $2.1m Arena funding) to convert the industry’s crop wastes (which are usually either burnt or left to degrade) into renewable fuels for farming and transportation.\n“What we’re looking to do is take this trash and bagasse and convert it into biogas through anaerobic digestion, and then upgrade the biogas into biomethane for use in diesel engines. We’re really taking an environmental issue and transforming it into something positive,” he says.\nAccording to O’Hara, the potential of the technology is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in sugarcane production by up to 80kg of CO2 per tonne of sugarcane produced.\nThere are four main elements of the project that will be demonstrated at Sunshine Sugar’s factories in the northern rivers region of New South Wales: finding a cost-effective way of collecting and transporting sugarcane trash to the factory; making the trash amenable to anaerobic digestion; upgrading the biogas to a transport-grade fuel; and upgrading the remaining digestate into a diesel replacement fuel.\nO’Hara says that, if successfully demonstrated, the technology could not only benefit the sugar industry but other industries with waste crops, such cotton or grain.\nIntegrating solar thermal energy into the Bayer alumina process\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAlcoa’s Western Australia alumina factory.\nAustralia’s huge alumina market not only produces millions of dollars for the economy but also millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions – largely produced from burning natural gas for heat in the refining process.\nHowever a new $15.1m project (which has received $4.5m of Arena funding) led by the University of Adelaide is hoping to sharply reduce the industry’s reliance on natural gas by identifying a cost-effective way to integrate low-temperature concentrated solar thermal (CST), solar reforming of natural gas, and high temperature CST in the Bayer refining process.\nRelated: Data is the secret weapon in the battle to save Australia's urban forests\nThe project will take place at one of mining company Alcoa’s Western Australian-based refineries, which use 25% of the state’s domestic gas supply.\nIt is hoped the project could reduce the use of fossil fuels in the Bayer process by up to 45% and could potentially be expanded into other mining and minerals processing operations in Australia and overseas.\nA robotic vision system for inspection and evaluation of solar plants\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDrones will be used to inspect solar equipment and reduce faults.\nDrones are rising high in the world of technology at the moment, being used for everything including pizza delivery, postal delivery and even collecting whale snot. Now the flying machines are being trialled for their ability to inspect solar farms.\nAfter construction, the primary costs associated with a solar power plant are from cleaning and maintaining, as a build up of dust and dirt on equipment (or worse, defective apparatus) can be a significant drain on power production.\nBut cleaning and maintenance takes up a lot of resources and can often result in equipment being cleaned only when convenient, rather than when necessary, which wastes water, a scarce resource in deserts, where solar farms are typically located.\nA $3.1m ANU-led project (with $875,000 Arena funding) is looking for a way in which drones could help to inspect solar photovoltaic panels and mirrors used at CSP farms in a cost-effective manner, and establish when best to clean them.\nThe drones, supplied by Canberra company 4D Surveying, will be fitted with “optical sensors, such as optical, polarization and thermal cameras, and laser scanners” and “powered by intelligent computer vision solutions” to measure the accumulated dust on panels and mirrors at solar farms.\nFollowing this, software will diagnose possible faults and produce “optimal route planning” to establish the most cost-effective cleaning procedures for the facility.\nAccording to ANU, if the project is successful, the efficiency of the solar power systems could be improved by up to 8%, which is a substantial amount given the size of these solar farms.",

The most senior Tory on the committee is Peter Lilley, a climate change sceptic in contrast with Yeo, who is a strong advocate of renewable energy.\nThe Sunday Times recorded Yeo on tape saying that he had coached John Smith, the managing director of GB Rail Freight, on what to say in front of his committee. The reporters were pretending to act on behalf of a fictitious South Korean solar energy company.\nYeo has denied the claims and said he did not ask questions at the relevant select committee hearing due to his declared financial interests, including being a director of GB Railfreight's parent company Eurotunnel. He also claims he only offered to represent companies, but do nothing in public.\nThe shadow cabinet office minister, Gareth Thomas, had piled pressure on Yeo in advance of his announcement, saying: \"David Cameron has revealed how weak he is. He has failed to show leadership over serious allegations that Tim Yeo coached a witness to the energy and climate change committee, and used his position to further the interests of his clients.\n\"Tim Yeo has the right to defend himself but it is difficult to see how he can continue as chair of the select committee pending investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner. If David Cameron won't act then Tim Yeo should take it upon himself to stand down from his post.\"\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, Yeo said: \"I did not 'coach' John Smith on this or any other occasion.

I want to make clear that I totally reject these allegations,\" Yeo said.\nThe former minister issued his statement shortly after he pulled out of interviews on the Murnaghan programme on Sky News and Sunday Politics on BBC1. His move followed a report by the Sunday Times Insight team alleging he had told undercover reporters he could use his contacts to further the interests of clients. The reporters were pretending to act on behalf of a fictitious South Korean solar energy company.\nYeo told the Sunday Times he could not speak in public on behalf of clients, but could talk to ministers in private. He was quoted as saying: \"What I say to people in private is another matter altogether.\" He added: \"If you want to meet the right people, I can facilitate all those introductions and I can use the knowledge I get from what is quite an active network of connections.\"\nYeo, who has referred himself to the parliamentary standards watchdog, said in his statement: \"The Sunday Times has chosen to quote very selectively from a recording obtained clandestinely during a conversation of nearly an hour and a half in a restaurant with two undercover reporters who purported to be representing a client from South Korea. My lawyer requested the whole recording from which these extracts were obtained but this has not been given.\"\nThe former minister, who was a leading moderniser long before David Cameron was converted to the cause, was quoted by the Sunday Times as telling the undercover reporters he had advised John Smith, the managing director of GB Railfreight, before he gave evidence to his committee. Yeo, a director of GB Railfreight's parent company Eurotunnel, recused himself from his duties as chairman when Smith gave evidence, but he told the Insight team: \"I was able to tell him in advance what he should say.\"\nIn his statement on Sunday Yeo said: \"I travelled with John Smith and two other people in the cab of a freight train for three hours on 16 May, five days before he appeared before my committee. I spoke briefly to Mr Smith about his forthcoming appearance in front of the committee to explain that because of the business connection between us I would not take part in questioning him.

He said: \"I refused to do this. After this refusal they pressed me to give them the names of MPs who would be interested in joining such a group. I refused to do this too.\"\nYeo said that the only document the Sunday Times mentioned was an email he had sent to the reporters saying that he had decided to withdraw from further discussions with them. He relayed his decision after the reporters emailed him on the morning of 22 May to say they were withdrawing their offer of work.\nIn his statement Yeo said: \"I am referring myself to the parliamentary standards commissioner because I wish to have this matter thoroughly investigated by an independent body. I am confident that I have acted in accordance with the MPs' code of conduct at all times.\"\nThe allegations about Yeo follow the announcement that three peers are to be investigated over allegations that they broke parliamentary rules over outside earnings after they were filmed by the Sunday Times.

        "conteudo": "After a verdict on Monday that will see the first operation to frack for shale gas in five years in North Yorkshire, anti-fracking campaigners have accused the county council of declaring war on people’s rights to clean air and water.\nTests for shale gas can now take place in the village of Kirby Misperton, in the Ryedale district, after councillors gave the green light to UK firm Third Energy. We asked those living in the area their views on fracking and whether they’ll continue protesting.\n‘This is strictly about business and profitability’\nI’ve been a resident in Kirby Misperton for 11 years and my house sits on the edge of the village overlooking the well site. This is a quiet village in a beautiful area with a famous zoo. I’ve taken part in protests in the past and plan to do so again in the future - I’m wholeheartedly opposed to fracking anywhere.\nLocally, pollution from increased traffic and constant noise and light pollution from the rig operations concerns me. The high risk of environmental damage with the threat of poisoning to our local water table as a consequence of operational mistakes from an untried and untrusted process is also worrying. There is also potential damage to property - a hike in house insurance premiums and a drop in property prices.\nNationally, I have no faith in a resource-stretched environment agency to administer regulations safely. There is no belief this policy will deliver the step change in sustainable energy supply being touted (many more wells will be needed over the entirety of Yorkshire). This is strictly about business and profitability - not people, our homes, our environment and our right to say no. Would you want to live 300m away from a drill site?\nNicholas Wilson, Kirby Misperton\nRelated: North Yorkshire council backs first UK fracking tests for five years\n‘Those who voted in favour of fracking do not represent the people of North Yorkshire’\nSeven councillors (against four) failed to listen to their constituents’ voices. This is a sad day for democracy, a sad day for North Yorkshire, for the UK, and ultimately for the planet. The most telling arguments for me against this decision are firstly the fact that proliferation is written into the application as many more applications will inevitably follow – why else would they frack? - and the government will be encouraged to uphold Cuadrilla’s appeal against the Lancashire planners’ decision. Secondly, this proliferation will render it impossible for the UK to meet its climate change commitments. This is a real blow for those concerned to draw attention to this government’s hypocrisy in withdrawing real support for alternative energy sources, whilst loudly maintaining the contrary; for failing to take the option for the poor as against the rich, the poor who will suffer first and most for this government’s insane devotion to fossil fuels.\nThose who voted to accept the application may indeed have believed that there are no risks which have not been adequately addressed by regulation, incredible though this does sound. What they cannot affirm is that the industry has ensured that there will never be adverse impacts. Those who, whilst not sure, still vote for fracking should not be representing us - the people of North Yorkshire. Those opposed to this pernicious practice are determined to fight on.\nDavid Cragg-James, Stonegrave\n‘At first I thought activists were overstating the case but there are reasons to be worried’\nI’m really concerned about the industrialisation of rural Britain. As someone who lives near a proposed fracking site, the implications in terms of resources and truck movements for license blocks stretching right across the country are huge. At first I thought the activists were overstating the case but the more you enquire into shale gas extraction the more reason there is to be worried. The potential scale of the enterprise has become apparent to me.\nThis is fossil fuel extraction! Climate change has been acknowledged at international level to be a critical issue. I don’t trust the idea that shale gas is a part of a careful plan to meet our carbon dioxide reduction targets. I want to see evidence of no nonsense government policies that head us directly towards a zero carbon Britain.\nThis is a game-changer. Do pro-fracking politicians appreciate the true scale of what they want to give the oil and gas companies the go-ahead to do? Geologists suggest there may be a lot of gas down there to extract. The government is doing all it can to clear the way for the companies to extract it. Naturally they want to extract as much of it as they can, why wouldn’t they, it is the business they are in! There are a hundred things I would rather be doing than fighting fracking. Sadly I’ve realised that if we don’t actively try to stop it, it will happen.\nAnonymous, Yorkshire\n‘We should be investing in renewables not taking more fossil fuels out of the ground’\nI am unhappy with the anti-democratic process that is happening with regard to fracking and want to stand up and show the government that what they are trying to impose on North Yorkshire and the rest of England is not OK. I have never protested about anything before in my 58 years of life but I plan to now!\nThe fear of contamination to the environment to the air we breathe, the noise, risk of water table contamination and risk of earthquakes concern me. There’s also the disruption and stress in our communities from heavy vehicles on our country roads, as well as unknown health effects to humans and wildlife. We should think about the impact of climate change for our children and grandchildren and be investing the money in renewables and not taking more fossil fuels out of the ground.\nKim, Hovingham\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAnti fracking protesters respond to the decision by North Yorkshire county council. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images ‘The development of sustainable energy will be set back’\nI live in an eligible fracking site and I’ve taken part in protests and plan to again in the future. I’m totally opposed to fracking. It threatens our air and water quality and water supplies. It poses risks to our physical and mental health. It will overwhelm our countryside and wildlife, and traffic will clog country lanes. Spills and methane emissions will cause pollution and hasten climate change. There are few economic benefits for the people whose homes will be devalued. The development of sustainable energy will be set back. Ban fracking now!\nMy health, my property, my water supplies, the countryside and wildlife and the future of our planet are my main concerns. Evidence from the US, Canada and Australia is emerging proving that fracking is harmful and the public are turning against it.\nMike Brookes, Yorkshire\nRelated: In the timeless Yorkshire moors of my childhood, the frackers are poised to start drilling\n‘The government is riding roughshod over local democracy’\nI have never campaigned in my life, but this industry has the potential to destroy north Yorkshire. It relies on tourism and agriculture for its thriving economy not the gas industry. In fact most of Ryedale doesn’t have mains gas! Transport on country roads, pollution, contamination, industrialisation of the countryside, threat to human and animal health concern me, as do noise and air pollution. The government is riding roughshod over local democracy in order to pave the way for this industry. It is short-term gain for the industry but is not economically viable and is unproven in the UK.\nAnonymous, Ryedale\n‘Protesters should give companies the chance to explain the benefits of fracking’\nAfter working in the oil and gas industry for nearly 40 years, and that means travelling over seas to numerous countries, I have seen first hand how fracking works. Does any one in their right mind really think that the government (with some of the best rules and regulations in the industry) would allow work that compromised the health and safety of the country or its people? Get real. I have no concerns about fracking. Those protesting should give the companies that are doing this work the chance to explain the benefits to everyone.\nCountry Man, North Yorkshire\n‘There have been too many accidents to feel confident about it’\nI plan on taking part in protests because the health of my grandson is at stake. The thought of him being at risk of asthma, allergy rashes and cancer causing toxins in both the air and water cause me great concern. Where will all the water come from for the drilling and where will the toxic water be disposed? Whilst some areas safely frack there have been too many accidents and spillages for me to feel confident in the industry and it’s alleged safety measures. Who will clean up when the work is finished and the wells start to leak?\nWendy Panther, Yorkshire\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn anti-fracking placard is placed against a bicycle outside the county hall building in Northallerton. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images ‘I have spent hundreds of hours on frack-free activities instead of enjoying my senior years’\nFor two years I have been involved in anti-fracking activities. Like many other people I am trying to preserve the British countryside, a highly valued and valuable asset. It seems outrageous that our government is flying in the face of common sense by encouraging oil and gas companies to carve up our heritage and increase carbon emissions. I am totally opposed to the development of a new fossil fuel energy. We should concentrate on renewable energy sources. Hydraulic fracturing has been shown to have many detrimental effects on the environment.\nI’m concerned by air pollution from the industry and fumes from the high volume of road traffic needed to ferry water to and fro; depletion of our normal water supply due to the high demands put on it by the fracking process; contamination of ground water, and the enormous change in the landscape from rural to industrial. There’s also noise and light emissions at unprecedented levels in the countryside which would have a detrimental effect on wildlife as well as human life, as well as the potential for seismic activity. There’s the loss of beautiful landscapes for short term financial gain and the loss of tourist and farming industries due to environmental damage.\nI am very angry that during the last two years I have been anxious about the impending prospect of being able to see well heads from my bedroom window, of the possibility of being unable to sell my house and that I have spent hundreds of hours on frack-free activities instead of doing more pleasurable, useful or enjoyable things in my senior years.\nMrs Resident, Pickering\n‘Fracking is a step back in energy policy’\nI plan to protest because despite overwhelming opposition to fracking in our community, the government wants to impose it upon us. The consequences of fracking are gravely serious and local democracy is being undermined by central government. The industrialisation of our beautiful county and the consequences on the tourist industry are at stake. The potential for our ground water and agricultural land to be irrevocably polluted is too high a price to pay to extract what is essentially a fossil fuel. It’s a step back in energy policy.\nFracked Off Mother, North Yorkshire",

        "conteudo": "One of the US’s largest unions voted to use political pressure to fight climate change on Tuesday, citing events such as Hurricane Sandy, the California drought and the water situation in Flint, Michigan, as examples of how the phenomenon disproportionately affects its members.\nRelated: Obama's methane rule an aggressive step toward tackling climate change\nMembers of the two-million-strong Service Employees International Union (SEIU) voted to add environmental justice to the list of the union’s priorities and to use its powerful voice at the state and federal level to put climate change on the political agenda in 2016.\nThe SEIU previously succeeded in making the fight for a $15 minimum wage a national issue and was able to get it on the legislative agenda in a handful of US states and cities. Its campaign led to major victories for the minimum wage movement in states including California and New York.\nThe union now hopes to do the same for climate change – a subject that has been largely absent so far from the 2016 presidential campaign. The proposal could prove controversial with some in the labor movement, considering that more than 100,000 energy-related jobs have been lost in the last year and a half.\nAccording to the SEIU, climate change disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities, where many of its members live. As such, the union is committing its resources to “broadening environmental justice”.\nThe SEIU international president, Mary Kay Henry, said: “SEIU members live and work in some of the most polluted zip codes in America and are part of communities that are most impacted by climate change. We know first-hand that our fights for economic, racial and immigrant justice are inextricably linked to the fight for environmental justice.\n“Our members adopted a platform today to take on the fight for environmental justice and to stand in solidarity with the rest of the labor movement to demand clean air and water, healthy and safe communities and a just transition for all workers affected by a transition to a clean energy economy.”\nBarbara Carr, 34, who works as a home healthcare worker in Flint, Michigan, said she voted in favor of the SEIU environmental commitment because of what she has “been through with my city and our water system”.\n“We should never have to worry about having clean water,” said the mother of three. Carr has lived in Flint all her life and has been working in healthcare since 2001. It is her hope that the SEIU will help expand water education outreach and help ensure that what has happened in Flint will not happen in other US cities.\nMartha Valladares, 67, also hopes that her community will become better informed about air and water pollution and the need to fight climate change. One of her daughters was diagnosed with asthma at three years old and even now, while working as a nurse, she has asthma and has to “carry her own breathing machine”. Valladares says air pollution is to blame for her daughter’s condition.\nRelated: Green really is the new black as Big Oil gets a taste for renewables\nThe SEIU’s commitment to environmental justice drew praise from the environmental movement as well as the White House.\n“We applaud SEIU’s commitment to cleaner air and water for our communities, their resolve to tackle the impacts of climate change especially amongst the most vulnerable, and their work to see that workers benefit from our transition to a clean energy economy,” said Brian Deese, senior adviser to the president.\nMichael Leon Guererro, national coordinator at the Climate Justice Alliance, described the SEIU as “a critical partner in building a diverse and powerful climate movement”.\nThe Sierra Club, America’s largest environmental group, welcomed the push, praising the SEIU as a “cutting edge, progressive union that is showing the way for the union movement”.\nDean Hubbard, director of the labor and economic program at the Sierra Club, said there was a “crying need for visionary leadership” in unions to embrace a clean energy economy.\nThe SEIU vote took place about a week after the union and environmental wings of the Democratic party’s base reportedly clashed over the input of wealthy environmentalist Tom Steyer.\nEarlier this month, it was reported that the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, was joining forces with three other public employee unions to form a Super Pac to campaign against Donald Trump in battleground states. The SEIU considered joining the Super Pac, but opted out, according to Politico.\nSteyer’s participation in this effort to elect Democrats raised concerns that jobs related to fossil fuel projects would be sacrificed in favor of fighting climate change.\n“We are not climate science deniers and have merely sought to ensure that the employment prospects of our members are not negatively impacted in any economic and energy transition,” presidents of seven building trade unions said in a letter to the AFL-CIO’s president, Richard Trumka. The unions, which represent workers such as engineers, roofers, plumbers and plasterers, said they would not participate in the Super Pac and requested that the AFL-CIO terminate ties with Steyer.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addresses SEIU members at the union’s 2016 International Convention in Detroit, Michigan.

She has also made this $1.2bn (£825m) paean to contemporary urban planning her home, countering a long tradition which dictates that Palestinian women stay with their parents until they marry, after which they move in with their in-laws.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCivil engineer Shadia Jaradat in Rawabi.

Seven hundred apartments have been sold, with the first residents moving in last autumn. Eventually, Rawabi will have a population of 25,000 in the core high-rise city, which could rise to 40,000 with future expansion.\nThe city is an urban planner’s dream, and the antithesis of the noisy, rubbish-strewn chaos of most Palestinian towns. The apartments have spectacular views over the biblical landscape of the West Bank. Birds of prey soar through the golden evening light. From the highest spots, it is possible to see the Mediterranean glinting beyond the Tel Aviv skyline, 25 miles away.\nResidential blocks are connected by landscaped walkways, communal gardens and squares, with vehicles restricted to outer roads and underground car parks. Power and telecommunications are delivered by underground fibre-optic cables. Children’s play areas, outdoor gym equipment and benches are scattered through each neighbourhood.\nThe apartments are finished to a high specification, with modern kitchens, integral appliances, tiled floors, recessed lighting and communal stores to keep garbage out of sight. Heating and air conditioning is delivered from a central source. Each flat has a balcony or terrace; there are 100 variations of design.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRawabi’s 12,000-seater amphitheatre.

A few top-of-the-range penthouse units have higher prices, but in general they are about 25% cheaper than comparable properties in nearby Ramallah, the overcrowded – and hence overpriced – economic and political hub of the West Bank.\nRawabi’s commercial centre has retail spaces, cafes and restaurants awaiting occupancy. “We’re trying to convince international brands, like Mango and Zara, to open here,” says Jaradat, noting that, as yet, there are no global chains in the West Bank. The blueprint includes copious office space, a creche, a seven-screen cinema, a convention centre and a hotel.\nRawabi sends a message to the international community. We are not what they are led to believe, a bunch of terrorists\nBashar al-Masri\nSeveral mosques and a church will provide worship space for the population. An industrial zone is situated on the city’s outskirts. One school is built, and another is planned. In a slick marketing centre, potential buyers can inspect scale models of the project, view a 3D promotional movie and consult representatives of Arab banks on finance options.\nAnd then there is Rawabi’s jewel: a vast, stunning 12,000-seat outdoor amphitheatre built into the hillside. Here, it is hoped, international artists will perform to audiences attracted to Rawabi from all over the West Bank and beyond.\nA soccer stadium, water park, all-terrain recreation vehicles, an overhead zipline – all add up to an ambitious plan to make Rawabi a desirable place to live and a popular destination to visit.\nBut – especially here – not everything goes according to plan.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPalestinian-American developer Bashar al-Masri. Photograph: Uriel Sinai/Getty Images\nSince Bashar al-Masri embarked on the Rawabi project in 2007, it has consumed every waking moment. “I have a lot more grey hair. I don’t think I’ve taken a single day of vacation. Maybe one. One single day. I never turn my mobile off. There have been many happy moments, but also many frustrating moments. It has not been an easy journey.”\nThe Palestinian-American businessman talks of his new city with passion. “This project sends a clear message. Despite all the obstacles the [Israeli] occupation puts in our way, we are determined to improve our lives and have our own state.\n“This is a mega-project, designed first for Palestinians. People stand on the top of the hill here and say: ‘Wow! This is for us?’ They see other places – in Dubai, Israel, the UK, America – on the internet, and now they see it in our own land, built by our own engineers and labourers. It brings national pride – yes we can, yes we can make a difference, despite all the misery.\n“And Rawabi also sends a message to the international community. We are not what they are led to believe, a bunch of terrorists. We are ready to build our state. Here is the proof.”\nGhost town\nIn 2012, ground was broken. By the middle of 2013, 600 apartments had been sold off-plan and another 8,000 people had registered as potential buyers. A year later, the first properties were finished and phase two was well under construction.\nBut by early 2015, Rawabi was a ghost town and Masri was contemplating bankruptcy.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA finalised neighbourhood in the new Palestinian city of Rawabi. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images\nThe issue that drove him and his mega-project to the edge of disaster was water. Masri spent two years trying to secure a dependable and adequate supply. Without it, Rawabi was dead.\nIsrael took control of West Bank water resources almost 50 years ago, when its occupation of Palestinian territories began. Under the Oslo Accords, signed in 1993, a Joint Water Committee (JWC) between Israel and the newly created Palestinian Authority (PA) was set up. The PA allocates water supply within the West Bank, but the amount of water supplied is determined by Israel.\nAny water deal for Rawabi needed to be agreed by the JWC. But the PA was mostly refusing to deal with the body in protest at the vastly favourable supply of water to Israeli settlements compared to Palestinian towns.\nRawabi was dry. “It was a super-critical two years,” says Masri. “We were ready to deliver apartments, and we needed $100m from buyers waiting to move in. But we couldn’t move forward.” Construction slowed and hundreds of buyers pulled out. “I really thought we would go bankrupt.”\nIn desperation, Masri appealed to his friends in international business and politics to intervene. One who advocated on behalf of Rawabi was former British prime minister Tony Blair, who would resign as Middle East envoy a few months later. “Blair was a supporter of Rawabi. He’s been here several times, he’s helped clear [political] obstacles,” says Masri.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTony Blair plants an olive tree at Rawabi in June 2010. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images\nThe water deal came through in March 2015. “We were allocated a quota of 300 cubic metres a day. Now, we’re already at the top of the quota, and we need more. But all Palestinian cities have water problems, all are asking for more water,” says Masri.\nWater was not the only problem. Rawabi is situated in Area A, the 18% of the West Bank that is under Palestinian control. But access to the city lies through Area C, the 60% that is under full Israeli control. Masri had to negotiate for permission to build a road on which trucks could deliver construction materials and cars and buses carry Rawabi workers – and, eventually, give Rawabi residents access to the rest of the West Bank.\n“It was discussed at the White House, with [UN secretary-general] Ban Ki-moon, with everyone. Finally we started digging, putting facts on the ground with this road. Eventually, in 2012, with a lot of international pressure, they gave us a temporary permit for the road, But every year it has to be renewed, or they could close the road,” says Masri.\n“We want to make the road permanent, we want to widen it and extend it. We’ve been back and forth for a long time. But I’m hopeful it will be approved in the near future.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn architect model of Rawabi. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images\nThe delays took their toll. “Before, for every unit I had 10 possible buyers. It became hard to find any.” The project is now three years behind schedule and has a funding shortfall of at least $150m, says Masri.\nBut the setbacks and difficulties go beyond the road and water delays.\n“To my knowledge, not another city in the world has been financed completely privately – every single thing from A-Z: sewage, water, schools, telecoms, electricity, roads, religious places. Everything is paid for by us, and we’re not happy with that,” says Masri.\nIn 2008, Masri signed a private-public partnership agreement with the PA, under which the latter would fund the city’s basic infrastructure to the tune of about $140m. “I’ve had nothing since then. The PA’s priorities should be not just politics and security but also the economy. I understand they are financially broke but they could have delivered more than moral support.”\nThe PA does not even provide a police presence in the embryonic city. “They agreed to open a police station five months ago, but they need Israeli permission. Nothing has happened. We wait. Until then, I am the police chief of this city.”\nAt the very least, he says, the PA could have directed international donors to Rawabi. The project was announced just before a conference in Paris in December 2007, at which billions of dollars in aid was pledged to boost the Palestinian economy and state-building projects.\n“I thought they’d be all over us,” says Masri. “I’m worried that the donor community remains focused on a welfare society in Palestine. But we need to generate long-lasting jobs rather than wait on handouts every month. We don’t want to rely on philanthropy.”\nImmunity to occupation\nMasri, 55, was born and raised in Nablus, a major commercial centre of the West Bank and a city which reputedly produced more suicide bombers than any other during the violent years of the second intifada, or uprising. He is a member of one of Palestine’s best-known and wealthiest families; his uncle Munib al-Masri is a prominent businessman and philanthropist, sometimes called the Godfather of Palestine.\nAfter studying and working abroad, mainly in the US, Bashar al-Masri returned to the West Bank in the mid-90s at a time when hopes for a lasting settlement to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict were high following the signing of the Oslo Accords.\nI want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not?\nBashar al-Masri\nBut Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem continued, Israeli settlements within the Palestinian territories multiplied, and the prospects of a Palestinian state receded. Masri launched a newspaper and built a successful business – and thought hard about how to breathe life into the dying Palestinian economy. Slowly his dream of a new city, a new beginning, began to take shape.\nHe drew on the expertise of international planners and architects to flesh out his vision, and secured funding from Qatar to augment his own massive investment. He bought the hilltop site as a deliberate riposte to Israeli settlers who sought out commanding positions for their burgeoning colonies (Palestinian towns and villages are usually found on valley slopes).\nKey to Masri’s dream was a sustainable city, attracting investment and jobs to the West Bank. His ambition was to lure hi-tech and service industries to the empty office spaces above Rawabi’s shopping mall, where they could take advantage of a relatively low-cost but highly educated and tech-minded young workforce.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA display living room in an apartment in Rawabi. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images\nThe advantage of telecommunications, he says, is its “immunity to occupation”. It does not need to overcome the hurdles of checkpoints and closures, import and export bans, and the vagaries of the Israeli civil and military authorities which control much of the West Bank. “I want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not? That would be our Marshall Plan.”\nRawabi has many critics. Some Palestinians have belittled it as a vanity project for Masri. Some say the cost of housing is way beyond the reach of most Palestinians, for whom a long-term mortgage is impossible. Some worry that the concept of small units for nuclear families or solo dwellers challenges traditional social norms whereby extended families live grouped together, providing mutual care for the old and the young.\nAnd some accuse Masri of cosying up to Israel in order to get his project off the ground. These critics say Rawabi risks “normalising” the Israeli occupation of the West Bank by embarking on such a major venture ahead of securing a Palestinian state. Some say his dealings with the Israeli authorities amount to “whitewashing” or “collaboration”.\nIt is true that Masri has negotiated with Israel over the water supply and the road, and that much of the construction materials used to build Rawabi came from Israeli suppliers.\nBut he shrugs off the criticism. “They’re entitled to to their opinion. A lot of things they accuse me of are not true. I don’t see dealing with Israeli companies as wrong – it’s almost impossible not to deal with Israel. 99.9% of Palestinian homes are built with Israeli cement. You got to any Palestinian shop, and people are buying Israeli ice cream.”\n“Some people say Rawabi sugarcoats the occupation. I disagree. Rawabi is being built despite the occupation. We expose the occupation by our battle for basic things like water and a road.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRawabi resident Mai Alzarou and her nine-month old daughter. Photograph: Harriet Sherwood for the Guardian\nHe describes some of his critics as “cappuccino leftists”. “Who decides what to boycott and what not to boycott? It’s okay to study at Tel Aviv university but not to buy Israeli cement?” (This is a dig at Omar Barghouti, a founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, who was a student at the institution.)\nBut, Masri concedes, anti-Israel slogans have resonance at a time “when Palestinians are being killed in cold blood”. Between October 2015 and March this year, 30 Israelis and two Americans died in a wave of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings by Palestinians. Over the same period, more than 200 Palestinians were killed, the majority while allegedly carrying out attacks.\nThe violence has had an impact on Rawabi, says Masri. “You can’t market nice new homes in a climate when people are being killed, when there are closures and demolitions [of Palestinian homes by security forces].”\nThe patterns of Palestinian society are changing\nMai Alzarou\nIt has also been a setback for Masri’s ambitions to attract tech companies to Rawabi. Despite his overtures, no international businesses have committed to locating in the city. “We’re struggling,” he admits.\n“We did Rawabi the awkward way – we built a city, then invited [businesses] to come. The norm is to first create jobs, then build a city around them.”\nBut, typically for Masri, he is undeterred. “I’m confident we’ll be able to do it. All over the world we have friends who are mesmerised by Rawabi. For the first time they see, hear, read, watch the Palestinian people doing something positive. The international community is on our side, not against us.”\nIn the meantime, the development of Rawabi itself has created thousands of jobs – and, unusually, almost half its workforce is female. This was deliberate. “Women are equally qualified and super-hardworking. We wanted to empower women in the workplace.”\nMasri is the father of two daughters in their early 20s. “I see how women can be at a disadvantage, and when the economy is bad, women get the worst part of it. Here, we are trying to build a civilisation, and that requires equality.”\nMore pragmatically, he adds: “And young people buying a home here usually need two salaries.”\nRelated: The story of cities, part 1: how Alexandria laid foundations for the modern world\nMai Alzarou and her family are typical of Rawabi residents. Alzarou, 25, an English teacher, her salesman husband and nine-month-old daughter moved to the city from Bethlehem last autumn. Their three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment was on sale for $120,000, but the Alzarous took advantage of a “rent-to-buy” scheme. They are paying $500 a month in rent for two-and-a-half years, and then will pay off the balance with a combination of savings and mortgage.\n“In Palestine we usually live in extended families. But not all young people think this is the best way. We wanted our own apartment with new neighbours,” she said.\nAccording to Jaradat, typical buyers are in their 30s with young families, with both husband and wife working outside the home in the private sector, well-educated and looking for a new lifestyle among other young families. Among the first 700 families, 10% are Christian compared to 3% in the overall population.\n“The patterns of Palestinian society are changing,” she says. “When I bought my apartment, my family didn’t understand. It’s not part of our culture, but I’m glad we’re changing that.”\nHow far and how deep the changes go is not known. Is Rawabi a momentous trailblazer or a colossal folly? Masri has no doubt, but others are watching cautiously.\n“My vision is not just Rawabi,” he says. “This is not about real estate, this is about change at the grassroots, it’s about empowerment. Rawabi is a pilot project that will start a domino effect. The only question is when.”\nDoes your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?

        "conteudo": "Sunny days have long been considered a competitive advantage for Brazil. Before the 2014 World Cup, the country’s tourist board set up a website allowing visitors to compare the number of sunny days in US and European capitals to cities in Brazil (eg Brussels 103, Rio de Janeiro 212). But while tourism may have been capitalising on the sunshine, the solar industry has not.\nAccording to statistics from the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency, Aneel, solar accounts for just 0.02% of the country’s energy. The bulk of the country’s energy generation (70%) is from hydropower.\nHowever, while demand for energy is increasing, multi-year droughts and widespread blackouts have created serious concerns about energy security for millions of businesses and homes. Despite a traditional lack of support (unlike Europe, China and the US, Brazil has not implemented feed-in tariffs or tax breaks), the government is now making efforts to diversify (pdf) the country’s energy mix with recent public auctions for solar and wind. Its 10-year energy plan released in 2014 estimates that 7GW of solar projects will be installed by 2024, making up 3.3% of Brazil’s energy mix.\nYet as Brazil struggles with deep recession, increasing public deficit and political paralysis, it could be smaller companies and social startups that fuel the spread of solar, especially in the favelas where access to electricity is not widespread.\nBoost for community solar\nNew regulations that came into effect in March aim to clear the way to make people into both consumers and producers of clean, low-cost electricity. They allow people to set up co-operatives to install grid-connected solar systems and be financially rewarded for contributions to the grid. The regulations also seek to cut red tape by simplifying and speeding up procedures for setting up and connecting solar systems.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLuiz Pacheco and Marcelo Vicintin, founders of Axis Renovaveis, a company selling solar energy. Photograph: Heriberto Araujo\nOne organisation likely to be a key beneficiary of the new regulations is Revolusolar. Located in Babilônia, a Rio de Janeiro favela in the Leme region of the city, it was founded in 2015 by a group of six local residents, aiming to bring green power to the people of the favela. Currently a non-profit, Revolusolar is hoping to become a co-operative later this year and is already supported by the Organization of Cooperatives in Brazil.\n“We live in an energy dictatorship dominated by big companies like [Brazilian oil giant] Petrobras. But this might soon change,” says Revolusolar co-founder Pol Dhuyvetter from the roof of his house, where he has just installed a set of 12 solar panels that he expects will supply 50% of his energy consumption. So far, 10 families have contacted the organisation to evaluate the eligibility of their homes for the grid-connected solar electric system.\n“It is difficult to understand how a country with such potential is not developing its solar energy system,” says Dhuyvetter.\nSolar’s promise for Brazil\nIf panels were installed on the rooftops of every house in the country, solar energy could supply more than double the Brazilian residential demand, according to Rodrigo Sauaia, president of the Brazilian Solar Power Association (Absolar).\nHe believes that the new regulations – for the first time establishing clear rules for community solar - combined with skyrocketing electricity costs due to droughts and over-dependence on hydropower energy will stimulate distributed generation in the coming years.\n“In 2015 we had only 1,731 small-scale solar systems connected to the grid, but we expect this number to grow to 1.2m in 2024,” he says.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA solar energy system in the state of Bahia. Lucineide Silva has created a small company that helps customers clean and maintain solar panels. Photograph: Greenpeace/Carol Quintanilha\nEnvironmental and social organisations such as Greenpeace have recently campaigned to push the Brazilian government to provide tax breaks for panels and loans to buy solar equipment, as high interest rates – currently 14.25% – threaten investment in renewables that take time to pay off.\n“There is a degree of reluctance from the government, but also a strong lobby [against solar] from major construction companies that finance political campaigns,” says Barbara Rubim, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil. These companies, some of which have an interest in the construction of huge, controversial dams such as the Belo Monte, have also become one focus of the country’s Lava Jato corruption investigation.\nSauaia is confident society and small- and medium-sized companies will lead the charge. One such innovative small business is Sao Paulo-based Axis Renovaveis, which offers clients a solution to cut their energy bills: install tailor-made solar systems on their rooftops without investing a single cent.\n“We just ask them to sign a 10- to 12-year contract to commit to buy the electricity produced by the solar system, which could represent up to 50% of their total demand,” says Luiz Pacheco, one of the company founders. “We guarantee a cheaper price than the market and we assume all financing, installation and maintenance costs.”\nAxis Renovaveis has funding from banks and private investors to cover upfront costs.\nPacheco argues that commercial clients – such as a major pharmacy retailer network – benefit from a 15% discount in their electricity expenses compared with previous bills. This creates an opportunity for a booming expansion of Pacheco’s business. “[Clients] have realised that they can easily save money in each of their hundreds of branches in the country. At the same time, they also contribute to the environment.”",

        "conteudo": "The UK government risks slowing the shift to clean energy sources by cutting support for renewable energy and strongly backing gas as a transitional fuel, according to the UN’s environment chief.\nAchim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), told the Guardian that he thought the UK’s push for nuclear and gas over renewables could be more costly in the long term.\nHis warning came as North Yorkshire council gave the go ahead for the first fracking tests in the UK for five years. Councillors gave the green light on Monday to UK firm Third Energy to begin hydraulic fracturing for shale gas at wells near the village of Kirby Misperton, in the Ryedale district.\nSteiner said that it was a “legitimate choice” for the government to pursue “intermediary steps” to decarbonise the economy, such as using gas rather than coal.\nBut speaking to the Guardian before the North Yorkshire decision, he said: “If you invest a lot in an intermediary solution, you’re essentially slowing down the long-term transition [to renewables] so you’ll just have to do many things much faster and you may face the risk of having to pay much more to do it [later down the line].”\nHe added that removing government support for renewable energy would hold back the sector. “The picture in the UK has become less clear [on green energy]. That will not necessarily stop renewable energy from moving forward, but I think it will have a dampening effect on the sector that’s so critical, and that’s the private sector,” he said.\nSince coming to power, the Conservative party has ended subsidies to onshore wind power, cut them for solar power and scrapped plans for zero-carbon homes, defending the changes as being necessary to protect consumers.\n“Whenever public policy becomes hesitant or reverses a policy there, you can create uncertainty. And that I think is probably where the UK, like other countries, do need to look very carefully at what they are signalling in this arena, which is the market, the investor, the funding.”\nA spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We are dedicated to reducing our emissions and moving to low carbon energy, but this has to be done in the most cost-effective way for households and businesses.\n“The UK remains an attractive location for investment in renewable energy. We are giving investors the longer-term certainty they need by announcing £730m of funding for renewables contract auctions to drive further investment and build on the record levels we saw last year.”\nOn nuclear power, Steiner said that it might make sense in some countries as a way to cut emissions, but ultimately he thought it would quickly be beaten by renewable energy on economic grounds.\n“Nuclear is an option that is clean in terms of CO2 emissions but economics is a very complicated subject, and the UK is just learning that firsthand with supposedly state of the art technology,” he said in a reference to the troubled plans for new reactors at Hinkley Point.\nSteiner, who is stepping down in June and moving to the Oxford Martin school at the University of Oxford, said it was “extremely important” that last year’s historic Paris climate deal should be formally ratified and adopted quickly, to send the right signal to businesses.\n“If you take Paris literally, it signals to the world that we will decarbonise our economies over the next 50 years. This is revolutionary, this is unprecedented. Unless we get markets, industry, technology to believe this is really going to happen [by ratifying soon], they’re not going to invest themselves in it.\n“Public budgets are usually 15-20% of GDP, so 80% of the economy [the private sector] sitting back is a death knell.”\nOn Donald Trump, who has pledged to unpick the Paris deal if elected US president and denies the science of manmade global warming, he said: “Whenever there is anywhere in the world someone saying I don’t believe in climate change, UNEP has to be worried. This is not a question of belief, it’s a question of science, of evidence.”\nBut he said that while the US, which is the world’s second biggest carbon emitter, was “still a very significant player”, it would be Africa that might decide the fate of the world’s climate.\n“This continent now has 1 billion people, it will double its population in the next 50 years, so we will have 2 billion Africans. If Africa were to go down the 20th-century fossil fuel path, the Paris agreement would almost become redundant. Because we would just add to the emissions footprint of the planet in such a magnitude that any attempt to decarbonise our economies wouldn’t work.”\nBut he argued that Africa was not going down that route, because it had fewer vested interests in fossil fuels and renewable energy provided a shortcut for the millions of Africans who still do not have access to energy.\nOver his 10-year term as the head of UNEP, the Brazilian-born Steiner has overseen a tripling of the organisation’s budget from $7m in 2012 to $21m for 2014-15, and beefed-up powers bestowed on it at the Rio+20 Earth summit in 2012.\nHis greatest achievements, he felt, were moving from an environment agenda “trying to save one lake, one forest, change one chemical at a time” to something much more systemic, and making green issues relevant to the economy. “UNEP has brought an economic understanding to the environmental agenda,” he said in an interview with the Guardian at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi.\nBut his biggest regret was not doing more on oceans. “It is a frontier that is in some ways abstract to us terrestrial beings. But it is fundamental to what is happening on our planet. The world needs to pay far closer attention,” he said.\n“In a world where most of our fish stocks are overexploited or declining, or where as one report says they will soon be more plastic in the ocean than fish, what kind of outlook is that for a civilised 21st-century society?”\nThe Guardian’s travel and accommodation was paid for by the UN.",

        "conteudo": "ExxonMobil moved to squash a well-established congressional lecture series on climate science just nine days after the presidential inauguration of George W Bush, a former oil executive, the Guardian has learned.\nExxon’s intervention on the briefings, revealed here for the first time, adds to evidence the oil company was acutely aware of the state of climate science and its implications for government policy and the energy industry – despite Exxon’s public protestations for decades about the uncertainties of global warming science.\nIndeed, the company moved swiftly during the earliest days of the Bush administration to block public debate on global warming and delay domestic and international regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to former officials of the US Global Change Research Program, or USGCRP.\nThe Bush White House is now notorious for censoring climate scientists and blocking international action on climate change by pulling the US out of the Kyoto agreement.\nThe oil company is under investigation by 17 attorney generals for misleading the public about climate change, and is facing a shareholder revolt at its annual general meeting on Wednesday by investors pressing Exxon for greater disclosure about the effect of climate change on its profits.\nIn early 2001, however, after Al Gore lost the White House to George Bush, Exxon officials apparently saw a chance to influence the incoming administration, according to former officials of the research program.\nThe government agency was set up in 1990 and charged with producing definitive reports to Congress every four years on the effects of climate change on the US. In the mid-1990s, as part of its legal mandate, USGCRP began organizing monthly seminars on climate science for elected officials and staffers in Congress.\nOn 29 January 2001, nine days after Bush’s inauguration, Arthur Randol, a former senior environmental advisor at Exxon, telephoned Nicky Sundt, then communications director for the research program, to inquire about the future of the lecture series.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nExxonMobil moved to squash the well-established series just nine days after the presidential inauguration of George W Bush, a former oil executive. Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters\nA few days earlier, Sundt had emailed a survey to congressional staffers seeking suggestions for the next lecture series. Exxon had not been on his distribution list, and Sundt said he was surprised to receive a call from Randol.\n“I thought it was very unusual, if not inappropriate, for a fossil fuel lobbyist to be calling me directly days after the administration was sworn in only directly to instruct me on how we would be communication to the Congress on climate change,” Sundt told the Guardian. “This is ExxonMobil reaching into the federal government science apparatus and seeking to influence the communication of science.”\nSundt, who now directs the WWF-US climate science programme (although he said he was not speaking on behalf of the organisation), said he made notes of the phone call.\nThe briefings had then been running for a number of years and were well regarded by Republican as well as Democratic staffers, according to Bryan Hannegan, a Senate staffer and scientist who went on to work for the Bush administration and is now at the National Renewable Energy Lab.\nBut the Exxon lobbyist saw it differently. “I very specifically remember him suggesting that the seminars were what he called ‘agenda-driven’, and he indicated that with the new administration and the Congress that – if the seminars continue – he hoped to see a different balance of viewpoints,” Sundt said.\nThat was Sundt’s only encounter with Randol. He told his USGCRP colleagues about the telephone call but did not speak out publicly until now.\nIn retrospect, Sundt said the telephone call was the first sign of the energy industry’s efforts to squash the agency’s reporting about climate change, and the broader debate about global warming, during the George W Bush era.\nBush went on to pull the US out of the Kyoto climate change agreement, and White House officials were later found to have played down scientists’ warnings about the dangers of climate change.\nRandol, who left Exxon in 2003 after 25 years with the oil company, was known to have played a key role in such efforts – even before Sundt came foward.\nOn 6 February 2001, not long after his phone call to Sundt, Randol wrote a memo urging the Bush administration demand seek the removal of Bob Watson, a well-regarded climate scientist, as head of the UN’s climate science panel, the intergovernmental panel on climate change.\nRandol describes Watson as “hand-picked by Al Gore”. “Restructure the US attendance at upcoming IPCC meetings to assure that none of the Clinton/Gore proponents are involved in any decisional activities,” the memo reads.\nIn the same memo, Randol also recommended sacking three US climate officials.\nThe Exxon lobbyist was extraordinarily successful. At the IPCC, Watson was replaced by Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian engineer who stepped down from the science panel last year after being accused of sexual harassment.\nFollowing Randol’s recommendations, a number of climate sceptics were appointed to the administration, including Harlan Watson, a then Republican congressional staffer, who went on to lead the US climate negotiating team.\nMeanwhile, Randol sought to put Exxon’s stamp on the blockbuster US climate reports. On 22 March 2002, Randol forwarded a company memo to the White House council of environmental quality suggesting an overhaul of the USGRCP’s national climate assessments.\nThe memo, which extolled Exxon’s qualifications in climate science, recommended the agency focus more on “gaps and uncertainties” in climate science.\nExxon and Russol did not respond to requests for comment.\nHowever, Mike MacCracken, a former chief scientist at the USGRCP, said Sundt’s account of the phone call fits in with his recollections of Exxon’s efforts to influence government climate science research. “I don’t recall the call directly but they were objecting to all sorts of things as the new administration came in,” he said. “I guess the Republicans were sort of pushing from Congress. They were taking over and they had their views.”",

Joyce rejected the idea, given that a wool floor price caused a stockpile which caused a temporary collapse in the industry. Fitzgibbon said the agricultural cooperative Murray Goulburn’s board was responsible for the current dairy crisis.\nLand usage questions drew applause. Di Natale called for an end to coal mining and coal seam gas, but Joyce said that although he agreed with a wind farm project in his electorate, he did not support a complete ban on coal and coal seam gas.\n“This is not a binary argument of banning it or allowing it,” said Joyce.\n“I don’t want mining on prime agricultural land. It needs to be protected. If you say banning mining or coal seam gas everywhere, I don’t believe that because it will put a lot of people out of work.”\nFitzgibbon also advocated a case-by-case basis for mining – arguing that energy poverty meant Australia had valuable resources to offer countries such as India.\nRelated: Barnaby Joyce launches dairy assistance package after cuts to milk price\n“There will be some coal seam gas projects that can be done without harm to the environment and water tables,” Fitzgibbon said. “There will be those which can’t be.”\nBut Di Natale accused the major parties of having a “revolving door” between former ministers and the mining industry. He named former National party leaders Mark Vaile and John Anderson and Labor ministers Greg Combet and Martin Ferguson.\n“You think that is a form of corruption?” asked Uhlmann.\n“You have to ask questions when you have this revolving door between our politicians and the coal and gas lobby and massive donations that flow back to the Labor party and to the Liberal National party from those fossil fuel interests.”\nDuring an argument about foreign ownership, Fitzgibbon accused Joyce of sending the wrong signals to the world when Australia needed to attract foreign investment.\nJoyce asked what he meant, to which Fitzgibbon replied, “I thought you went to a private school”.\nIn response to a question about Indigenous employment opportunities, Joyce said “everybody wants to make sure we work with Aboriginal Australians”.\n“I work with Aboriginal people in my area and assist them to get the fruits of their nation because they were here first.”\nDi Natale urged Joyce to fund a program of 5,000 Indigenous rangers, while Fitzgibbon said the first step would be to fund the Gonski education model.\nBut one of the biggest audience responses on the night followed a question on the internet and the cost of data in rural areas compared with cities.\nRelated: NBN: the trouble with Coalition's plan for quicker and cheaper broadband\n“Why do telecommunications [companies] charge $100 for a terabyte in the cities but [for] residents of small towns they charge nearly $10,000 for a terabyte?” asked the audience member.\nFitzgibbon said there was “no bigger issue” than network speeds and data.\n“Under our NBN proposal we had a very important measure and the wholesale access would be equal whether you lived in the capital cities or deep rural Australia,” he said.\n“Barnaby wants to get rid of that equalisation and people in regional Australia will be paying more. There is no greater divide between city and country than the transformation push effect of the internet.”\nJoyce said data over wireless or fibre to the node was the same price, wherever it was used.\n“If you use wireless, you will pay the same price wherever you use it,” Joyce said. “If you use fibre to the node, you will be paying the same price wherever you use it.”\nOn the eve of the debate, Joyce used his electorate to announce a dairy package which extends concessional loans previously used for drought and the farm household cash payments worth $1,000 a fortnight.",

Commitments on human rights, asylum seekers, foreign aid, global warming and clean energy investment have all gone backwards in recent years, he says.\nHe says the Greens are the only party that understands the threat to national security from global warming, while also recognising that Australia can harness its vast reserves of renewable energy for great opportunity.\nLast week senior Labor figures accused the Greens of making a preference deal with the Liberals after the Victorian Liberal president, Michael Kroger, indicated his willingness to preference the Greens over Labor.\nLabor’s Anthony Albanese, who is being challenged in his Sydney seat of Grayndler by the Greens, accused them of agreeing to issue “open tickets” without any preference recommendations in numerous marginal seats, mostly in Victoria, in exchange for the Liberal party preferencing the Greens ahead of Labor in some inner-city seats in Melbourne and Sydney.\nDi Natale ignores the row in his Lowy Institute speech, saying only that he would work with “whoever is in government” to reap the potential that Australia’s energy exports and technology transfer programs held for the new economy.\nRelated: April breaks global temperature record, marking seven months of new highs\n“We need a government that understands our collective economic future is clean and green, or it is no future at all,” he says. “There are great opportunities for an Australia that capitalises on this vision – as one of the sunniest and windiest countries in the world, Australia can lead the transition to a clean energy powered future.\nThe Greens are calling for global diplomatic efforts towards an international agreement on how to respond to people displaced by global warming, he says.\nHe suggests Australia should start issuing a special form of humanitarian visa for such people.\n“No matter what strategy is deployed, given the slow pace of global negotiations set against our rapidly changing weather systems, the Greens would like to see plans put in place for this process and planning to commence now – there is no time to waste,” he says.",

        "conteudo": "Plans by Japan to build dozens of coal-fired power stations will cause at least 10,000 premature deaths, according to a study, as the country struggles to fulfil its climate change obligations five years after the Fukushima disaster closed down almost all of its nuclear plants.\nGreenpeace and the environmental group Kiko Network said in a joint report that Japan’s determination to press ahead with a massive expansion in fossil fuel-based power production, with at least 43 plants to be built over the next 12 years, would come at a price to human health and “lock in carbon emissions for decades”.\nThe warning comes after a meeting of the G7 environment ministers in Toyama at the weekend, at which Japan repeated its pledge to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2013 levels by 2030 – a target campaigners have derided as woefully inadequate.\n“Six large coal-fired power plants are planned within 100km of Tokyo. This massive expansion of coal power generation so close to huge urban areas like Tokyo is simply insane,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior coal campaigner at Greenpeace.\n“We could save thousands of lives cut short from air pollution if the government chose to embrace renewable energy over dirty coal. Japan is already considered the worst performer among the G7 when it comes to phasing out coal. If we are to have any chance of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, fossil fuels must be kept in the ground – not pumped into the air over our cities.”\nRelated: Air pollution 'kills 7 million people a year'\nUsing atmospheric modelling to gauge the potential effects on public health, the groups projected that between 6,000 and 15,000 people would die prematurely in the Tokyo area over the new plants’ average operating life of 40 years.\nAdditional plants near the Osaka and Hyogo regions in western Japan would cause 4,000-11,000 premature deaths over a similar period.\nProjected particle pollution emissions from the new power plants around Tokyo would be equivalent to that from 13m passenger cars, the report said.\nA study published last week by Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment said Japan risked being saddled with a fleet of worthless coal-fired power stations due to overcapacity and lower energy costs.\nThe school’s sustainable finance programme said overcapacity, combined with global moves to cut carbon emissions and the shift towards more cost-effective renewables, could leave the country with a stranded investment in coal plants worth $56bn\n“The expansion of coal in Japan appears to be predicated on a benign environment for incumbent utilities,” the programme’s director, Ben Caldecott, said.\n“The reality is that disruption in the power sector is accelerating. The idea that the power sector will remain relatively static and ‘safe’ for new coal-fired power stations is counter to the evidence we see internationally across the G20.”\nThe G7 environment ministers’ meeting ended on Monday with a pledge that countries would not wait until the deadline of 2020 – set at last year’s UN climate conference in Paris – to decide how they will achieve their long-term emissions cut of 80% by the middle of the century.\nBut there are growing doubts that Japan, the only G7 country investing in new coal plants, will even achieve its 2030 target.\nIn contrast to the US, Britain and other developed nations that are abandoning coal, Japan has turned to fossil fuels to fill the energy gap left by the closure of dozens of nuclear power plants in the wake of the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011.\nAll but two reactors remain offline while they undergo safety checks, while potential reactor restarts have encountered strong opposition from residents concerned about the facilities’ vulnerability to powerful earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions.\nJapan relied on nuclear for about 30% of its energy needs before Fukushima and, despite the shutdowns, the government says nuclear will generate 20-22% of total electricity by 2030.\nIts enthusiasm for coal is at odds with sections of the business community, however. Japanese trading house Mitsui said last week it would trim its thermal coal investments amid growing pressure worldwide for firms to lower their dependence on fossil fuels.\n“Considering the result of the global climate summit (in Paris), we basically plan to reduce thermal coal assets,” Mitsui’s chief executive, Tatsuo Yasunaga, told analysts.\nKimiko Hirata, the international director of Kiko Network, said: “Governments that have signed the Paris agreement must now legislate to keep fossil fuels in the ground and strongly support policies which lead to 100% renewable energy.\n“Following the Fukushima disaster and subsequent shutdown of its nuclear fleet, Japan has been setting global records for energy consumption reduction, while renewables such as solar, have been booming.\n“Japan needs to give renewables priority access to the grid and stop wasting resources trying to restart nuclear plants and expanding dirty coal.”",

        "conteudo": "The government’s $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, which pays greenhouse gas emitters to pollute less, will inevitably pay for reductions that would have happened anyway, for the same reason that secondhand car markets are full of lemons, an economic analysis has concluded.\nThe centrepiece of the government’s Direct Action climate policy is a reverse-auction, in which polluters bid for funding to pollute less.\nBut the government could not know for sure whether those reductions would have happened anyway, the economist Paul Burke from the Australian National University has argued in the journal Economic Papers. And any reduction scheme that was going to go ahead anyway would be able to outbid schemes that required funding to go ahead, he wrote.\n“They have a cost advantage that makes them well placed to win the auction,” Burke said.\nRelated: Greg Hunt hasn't a lot to show for $660m spent on reducing greenhouse emissions\nSimilar criticism of Direct Action has been raised before, but had received little attention from economists, Burke said.\n“Anyway projects”, as Burke called them, were likely win the reverse auction for the same reason that buyers of secondhand cars were likely to buy a lemon. In both cases, the buyer could not know whether the product was good quality, and the seller with a bad product could undercut the rest of the market.\nThe government used dozens of methods to avoid paying for abatement that would have happened anyway, but it could not know what a company was planning to do, Burke said.\nIn his discussions with local stakeholders, he said, some recipients of emissions reduction fund money described it as “cream” and “too good to be true”.\nBurke said it was entirely possible some projects would end up, perversely, funding emissions increases. An example of that could be farmers getting a payment not to clear one piece of land, and using that money to fund the clearing of land elsewhere.\nExamining some of the projects that were awarded payments in the first two rounds of the auction, Burke found farmers were often paid more than the value of their land simply not to clear parts of it. In some cases, he said, the incentive for the farmers to clear the land was low, and it would have been expensive, so might not have happened anyway.\nEnergy efficiency projects that upgraded lighting in supermarkets or reduced fuel use in vehicles fell into a similar category. “That’s the sort of activity that private companies are supposed to do,” Burke said. “Companies do do this sort of activity – it’s not uncommon for companies to replace their vehicles with newer or more fuel efficient ones,” he said.\n“Not all the projects are like this, but it’s a pity that some projects can get into the scheme when they are not delivering true additional abatements,” he said.\nRelated: Two-thirds of Australia's emissions fund spent for just 7% of 2030 target\nHe said a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme was more effective, partly because it didn’t require the government to know unknowable facts such as a company’s plans.\n“The previous policy of carbon pricing was a more effective approach than Direct Action,” he said.\nLabor has promised to implement a type of emissions trading scheme if elected in July.\nThe environment minister, Greg Hunt, said he rejected the report “clearly, categorically, absolutely”.\n“The head of the emissions reduction assurance committee is from ANU – Professor Andrew Macintosh. He takes a very different view to one of his colleagues. And what we’ve seen is 143m tonnes of emissions reduction allocated by the independent Clean Energy Regulator. These are using overwhelmingly Labor’s methods, but for new projects.”",

        "conteudo": "A group of Republicans has written a playbook that purports to answer the question puzzling Hillary Clinton, conservatives and advertisers everywhere: what do millennials want?\nAlexandra Smith, chairwoman of the College Republican National Committee, told reporters on Wednesday that the plan, titled Millennial.GOP, was meant to help “Republican candidates up and down the ballot” persuade young people to support the party. The plan was based on a survey of 800 adults aged 18 to 29 and focus groups in the Denver area.\nSmith said millennials were “one of the most freedom-loving generations” in history, and argued that they were thus open to the charms of the Republican party. But she stressed that candidates would have to work for the affections of young people, saying Republicans have “a long way to go on our personal brand”.\nStep one, per the report: show you care.\n“Republicans have a caring gap,” said Kristen Soltis Anderson, a co-founder of research company Echelon Insights and a columnist at the conservative Washington Examiner. She added that there were “a lot of issues where young voters aren’t quite sure that Republicans care”.\nAccording to Soltis Anderson, young people want “someone who’s kind to people from all walks of life” and “has empathy for people from all sorts of backgrounds”. In particular, she said, “they want politicians to understand that not everybody has opportunity”.\nIn their advice to Republicans, the report’s authors dabbled with the language of Democrats. They wrote that Republicans should talk about “how to break down barriers, many of which are rooted in a centralized, top-down government that has fallen down on the job” – a mirror of Hillary Clinton’s “breaking every barrier” slogan that singles out big government rather than the racism, sexism and industry deregulation railed against by the Democratic frontrunner.\nClinton has struggled to win over young people: her opponent, 74-year-old Bernie Sanders, has won the youth vote by extraordinary margins, though not nearly enough to prevent his rival from an almost certain nomination.\nAt least two of Clinton’s key issues feature prominently in the Republican playbook, and constituted another step in the report: talk about privilege.\n“The happy talk that we all have this great opportunity in America just doesn’t resonate” with young people, Soltis Anderson said. Republicans should talk about “issues of privilege, issues of race and gender”, she added, because inequality of all kinds – particularly of wealth and income – is on millennial minds.\nThe report also tested focus groups with dueling Republican v Democratic proposals to key issues, such as student debt and regulation, and again tried to flip typical Republican rhetoric on its head. After being shown a video of the House speaker, Paul Ryan, talking about “bottom-up” economics, a 24-year-old college student, quoted as Dereck, noted the dissonance.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBernie Sanders, has won the youth vote by extraordinary margins. Photograph: Andy Alfaro/AP\n“Funny how he said bottom-up instead of top-down, but the party that he is affiliated with literally had trickle-down economics,” Dereck said. “It just seems a little crazy.”\nThe report also found that clean energy, equal pay for women, addressing poverty, student loan reform and better public school funding were four of the six “very important” issues to young people – all issues either opposed or bitterly disputed by Republicans in Congress.\nBut the authors of the report found ways to spin some issues to young audiences, largely with language such as “open”, “natural”, “local”, “warm” and “authentic”.\n“Simply saying the words ‘open’ and ‘bottom-up’ alone are not enough to woo a skeptical generation,” they wrote, but certain tacks could still work. They suggested talking about contraception access in terms of “over the counter access”, for instance, versus “the status quo” of Barack Obama’s healthcare reform.\nSimilarly, although most young people support the rights of same-sex couples to marry and protections of LGBT rights, the authors wrote that “millennials are not necessarily comfortable with forcing a business owner to violate his or her religious beliefs, either”.\nThe authors stressed that their report was for all Republicans, and said young people should be educated about “freedom” because “they have no clue about ‘freedom’ in their own lives, no hint of why they need it, when they use it, or how to value it”.\nThe key, according to the authors, is to speak about freedom “in practice”, particularly through millennials’ “ability to connect with others and share information”: their phones.\n“Our phones are not something ‘other’ than us. They are us,” they wrote. “We are one with everyone, everywhere. That connection expands what we can do, which necessarily expands who we are and what we can become.”\nSimply saying the words ‘open’ and ‘bottom-up’ alone are not enough to woo a skeptical generation\nThe report\nIn stark contrast to this language of openness stands the party’s nominee for president, Donald Trump, who has proposed closing the country to Muslims and refugees and promised to build a wall along the border with Mexico. His name was entirely absent from the written report.\nBut Soltis Anderson said Trump “could capitalize on some of these themes”, particularly “this fundamental distrust of what’s going on here in Washington, that Washington is broken, it’s inept”.\nIn an April poll by Harvard University, only 25% of people aged from 18 to 29 said they would vote for Trump, versus 61% who said they would vote for Clinton. Trump’s net favorability among the people surveyed was -57, and even among young Republicans only 37% saw him favorably versus 57% who disliked the former TV show host.\nYears of polling suggest that young people have become more liberal than not, including in their acceptance of same-sex relationships and favorable views of socialism. Demographic changes have also diminished Republicans’ base of older white voters: millennials are the most racially diverse generation in US history.",

The directive applies to some 30 household and commercial electrical items.\n\"This will save consumers money. This will spur innovation and this will conserve tremendous amounts of energy,\" Obama said.\nHe was flanked by Steven Chu, the energy secretary who has long seen energy efficiency as a crucial part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe push for household energy efficiency was seen as a further sign of Obama's determination to break with Bush policy on the environment.\nIn another development, the Obama administration showed it would take a far more robust approach to enforcing environmental protection. A lawsuit filed by the justice department charged the Westar power company of Kansas with failing to meet its legal obligation to install the best available pollution controls on its coal-fired plant.\nObama also used the visit to try and sell his economic rescue plan, saying the package, now approaching $900bn, would help spur the growth of clean energy, with new well-paying jobs in the wind and solar power industries.\nObama set aside some $30bn for energy efficiency measures in the economic rescue package now making its way through Congress, mainly modernising buildings.\nThe presidential memo on efficiency would seek to end a logjam at the energy department. The new energy standards demanded by Obama today were long overdue.\nCongress has been pushing for nearly three decades for higher standards on household products such as water heaters and refrigerators. But the energy department has regularly missed deadlines for imposing the new standards.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Obama's directive would also lead to a review and possible tightening of the standards under consideration by the energy department.\nThe president said he asked the energy department to move ahead on those appliances that would produce the biggest savings for consumers.\nThe White House said the energy savings from the changes would save Americans $500bn on their electricity bills, or the equivalent of two years worth of emissions from all of America's coal-fired power plants over the course of 30 years.\nIn the justice department law suit, the Environmental Protection Agency notified Westar Power that it was in violation of pollution control requirements five years ago. However, under Bush, the EPA rarely followed up on enforcement.\nThe justice department said its suit was \"part of a national initiative to stop illegal pollution from coal-fired power plants\".\nThe move stoked expectations of similar actions against a number of other coal-fired plants.",

So are we stuck with an internet of either stupid or evil things? Or is there another option?\nThe way out is counterintuitive. In short, we need to forget about the things. We need to stop obsessing over “smart” objects, and start thinking smart about people.\nWe can hardly tear our gaze away from our portals to the internet. And these devices are getting in our way. Being chained to our desks is lopping chunks off our lifespans. Staring at our smartphones is damaging our spines. We’re losing sleep. Our eyesight is failing. Our very identities are threatened by the opaque web.\nSomething must change.\nWearables are not enough\nSo far, the most high-profile attempts to reimagine our portals – Google Glass and the Apple Watch – have been disappointing variations on a theme. They’re still screens, whether on your face or on your wrist.\nBut our default way of interacting with the world isn’t by peering at screens. We respond to the environment, to what it offers us, in an automatic and intuitive way. In most everyday scenarios, we don’t see our things as things at all. We just use them: we see a hammer, and we grasp it. We see a rubber ball, and we squeeze it, or bounce it.\nThis was Heidegger’s insight, and it also motivates the enchanted objects thesis. The world presents itself, in the first instance, as ready to hand – as being available for use. We manoeuvre things with our bodies unthinkingly, performing immensely complicated calculations without even being aware of it.\nThe world is full of information that we access instinctively. But so far, this knowledge has been useless in the resolutely two-dimensional digital world. The challenge, and the opportunity, is to harness our knowledge of how real, graspable and bounceable things work, and use it to shape more meaningful, fulfilling, connected experiences. But how?\nIn search of a ‘digital Bauhaus’\nBack in the early 20th century, the Bauhaus movement defined itself with two slogans: first, that form should follow function; and second, that design should be truthful to materials.\nBauhaus designs were honest. No more gold-toned metal, or stone carved into rose petals, or faux Greek columns to make a building look serious. We should know instinctively what an object does just by encountering it.\nScreens don’t communicate anything about what they do. They remove us from our surroundings. And not only that, but as we tap and swipe merrily past terms and conditions, our personal information is siphoned off to third parties so invisibly and incomprehensibly that we can easily ignore that it is happening.\nBut what if we could design objects that utilised the internet in truly smart, differentiated ways, while also communicating their own function? What if we could understand this function intuitively, effortlessly? And what if these objects showed us – actually showed us, through their design features, their data flows and their legally-binding background conditions – how our information is being used, who can access it, where it is going, and why?\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCentre Georges Pompidou, close-up. Photograph: Allan Baxter/Getty Images\nWhat if, like the Pompidou Centre, the pipes of each thing were worn on the outside, arguing the case – rather than merely assuming it – for why we need to network it in the first place?\nThe digital world is up for grabs\nThis is the true potential of the internet of things. It could put our vast stores of tacit, embodied knowledge to work online. It could unite the physical and digital worlds. And it could put us in control of our own information and contextual integrity, against a moral and political backdrop that is resolutely committed to human rights, the rule of law and social cohesion. It could become an internet, not of smart things, but of smart, empowered people.\nIt’s hard to see what this would look like, exactly. But imagining it shouldn’t just be delegated to tech companies and opportunists riding the hype cycle. Artists, designers, philosophers, lawyers, psychologists and social workers must be just as involved as engineers and internet users in shaping our collective digital future.\nThe internet has become such an ubiquitous part of our lives that we tend to forget that it is in its infancy. It’s still just a crude prototype of what it could be. The internet of the future doesn’t have to be like the internet of today: flat, monopolised and dangerously opaque. Its form, contours and feel are still, quite literally, up for grabs.",

        "conteudo": "For tourists relaxing in the hot springs of Iceland's famous Blue Lagoon, just outside the capital Reykjavik, the issues of climate change and energy security are not likely to be occupying most bathers' minds. But what many visitors may be surprised to know is that the hot water they are sitting in is part of a remarkable journey by one country from oil dependence to a world leader in harnessing renewable energy.\nIceland's stunning scenery, with its bare, lava-strewn flats, snow-capped mountain ranges, glaciers, volcanoes and hot springs, is due to its location on one of the earth's major fault lines, the mid-Atlantic ridge. While this landscape is attracting an increasing number of tourists each year, the country's geographical peculiarities also mean that Iceland is the only country in the world that can claim to obtain 100% of its electricity and heat from renewable sources.\nThe glaciers and rivers of the interior of the country are harnessed to generate 80% of the country's electricity needs through hydropower, while the geothermal fields provide up to 20% of the country's electricity needs. These underground fields, which give tourists and locals their bathing pools, also provide Icelanders with an almost limitless and inexpensive supply of natural hot water.\nThere is no national grid in Iceland – harnessing the energy comes via the remarkably simple method of sticking a drill in the ground near one of the country's 600 hot spring areas, and using the steam that is released to turn the turbines and pump up water that is then piped to nearby settlements.\nGeothermal water is used to heat around 90% of Iceland's homes, and keeps pavements and car parks snow-free in the winter. Hot water from the springs is cooled and pumped from boreholes that vary between 200 and 2,000m straight into the taps of nearby homes, negating the need for hot water heating. It's also purified and cooled to provide cold drinking water.\nWhile the government believes that exploiting geothermal energy for space heating alone saves Iceland $100m (£50m) in imported fossil fuels each year, it also means less CO2 emissions. If the geothermal energy used for heating homes in a single year is equivalent to the heat obtained from the burning of 646,000 tonnes of oil, the government estimates that the total release of CO2 in the country is cut by nearly 40%.\nBut the task remains to move the country's remaining fossil fuel-dependent sectors to clean technology: Iceland's fishing fleet, cars and buses, which run on oil and petrol, ironically make the country one of the highest per head greenhouse gas emitters in Europe. Research is underway on how to use geothermal electricity to split hydrogen from water, and then to use hydrogen fuel cells to power the country's vehicles and fishing trawlers.\nIn 20-30 years, if this is achieved, it would make Iceland self-sufficient in energy terms, and 100% powered by renewable energy.\nEnergy by accident\nGeothermal energy in Iceland happened by accident. In 1907, a farmer in west Iceland took steam from a hot spring that ran below his farm through a concrete pipe and into his house several metres above. A few years later, another farmer became the first Icelander to use hot spring water for heating, and extensive distribution of hot water to heat homes began in the capital in 1930.\nIcelanders began to harness their natural powers into the 1940s, but was still getting 75% of it energy from coal until the oil crisis of the 1970s forced it to change its energy policy. With rising costs, the government moved its focus from oil to hydropower and geothermal heat. It put funding and resources into searching for new geothermal resource areas, and built new heating services and transmission pipelines from thermal fields into towns, villages and farms.\n\"When the oil crisis receded in the 1980s all the interest other countries had shown in renewables disappeared and they fell back on their oil-reliant ways,\" says Einar Karl Haraldsson, the chief political adviser to the Icelandic foreign ministry. \"But we continued to make progress in renewable energy development and now Icelanders are going to reap the benefits.\"\nThe economic savings gained by switching from oil to geothermal energy – an estimated $8.2bn over 30 years - have contributed significantly to Iceland's prosperity – transforming it from one of the poorest countries in the EEA to one of the most productive in the world in terms of GDP per capita and quality of life rankings.\nDigging deeper\nGeologists say that Iceland has barely scratched the surface of its geothermal energy potential. The country's National Energy Authority estimates that only 20-25% of the technically and environmentally feasible hydropower, and only 20% of the conventional geothermal potential available for electricity production in Iceland, have been harnessed.\nAlbert Albertsson, the deputy chief executive officer at Iceland's Resource Park, which includes the Blue Lagoon hot springs and one of the country's largest geothermal power stations, says that while no one knows how much energy could be eventually harnessed, it could be possible that all the energy needs of the northern hemisphere could be met by Iceland.\n\"What you've got to remember is that we've been working on this for less than 30 years,\" he said. \"We really have only harnessed a tiny fraction of the potential energy.\"\nThe government has embarked on a research project at the Resource Park to drill boreholes down to greater depths of around 5km, which would yield far greater power than the conventional bores which only reach depths of 2-3km.\n\"The water pumped into those bores will reach an unbelievable pressure and deliver four to five times the power yield of conventional bores,\" added Haraldsson.\nThe energy sector in Iceland is expanding continuously, and the country is now exporting expertise in this field. New hydroelectric power stations are under construction and there are plans for five or six more. Electricity produced from geothermal sources is expected to double by 2010, but the government is being careful to balance economic needs against any environmental impact.\nHowever, in terms of business, new industrial users that harness geothermal energy on a large scale have not yet emerged in spite of the high potential.\nThe country's substantial aluminium manufacturing sector has moved to using geothermal energy to power its smelting process, and natural resources are also used in the processing and production of salt, seaweed, pet food and fish farms and to heat the greenhouses that grow the island's fruit, vegetables and flowers. The tourism economy has also benefited, with more people coming to visit and bathe in the hot springs.\nBut Iceland's remote location means that even if it does tap into more of its natural energy resources, it has no way of exporting it. And so it has embarked on a drive to attract more industries to its shores that can exploit its supply of green and cheap energy.\nGreen data centres\nIt has set its sights on the IT sector, with its huge energy demands and growing emissions, which are estimated to account for 4% of UK emissions (aviation is only 2%).\nHaroldsson says the country has the potential to become a \"hotspot\" for data storage centres because of Iceland's cheap and reliable energy supply, naturally cool environment, no need to pay future carbon taxes, an abundance of land and a population which is politically secure and boasts a high level of computer literacy.\n\"In the big cities where many firms locate their data centres, energy is either expensive or polluting, if it is available at all,\" he said. \"We have energy and we also have a cold environment and an abundance of clean water for cooling [data centres].\"\nThe first to bite is Hitachi Data Systems, which recently announced a partnership with Data Islandia to offer its multinational customers data storage in a new facility powered by 100% green energy.\nHitachi plans to build its first centre by this summer, and there are plans for a further five or six large-scale centres in the geologically stable south-west of Iceland over the next five years.\nHitachi's centre is still in the planning stages but early drafts show how it will be built partly underground in a way that doesn't disrupt the natural landscape and uses green construction methods and materials. It takes into account the passive cooling that will be provided by Iceland's climate, in which temperatures rarely rise above 21C in the summer. The roof will be covered in moss and the resulting condensation will cool the centre even further, while the curved dome-shaped roof will help to draw cool air across its surface.\nHitachi's ecosolutions spokesman, Alec Bruce, says that such a design can save 60% of the energy required to cool a conventional data centre, and by customising its clients' varying storage needs (for example, powering down data that does not need to be accessed as regularly as others), it can save a further 30%.\nBruce says Hitachi's customers have \"responded aggressively\" to the opportunity which gives businesses with burgeoning carbon footprints and data storage costs the chance to boost their green credentials while saving money.\nIn a bid to convince more firms to locate their data centres on the island, Iceland's government has cut corporation tax to 15% and committed to laying new high-speed data cables to improve the connections with Europe and north America.\nCredit crisis\nThe drive to attract new industry to Iceland has become even more critical of late, with the warnings last week that Iceland may be one of the first economies to feeling the effects of the global credit crunch.\nRisk-averse investors have begun pulling out of the country and the Icelandic krona has fallen by 25%. Inflation is running at 6.8% and interest rates reached 15.5%.\nBut while the prospect of an economic downturn is of course unwelcome, ultimately Iceland's potential to exploit its natural resources means – just like those bathers in the hot springs – that energy security is at least not an immediate concern.",

        "conteudo": "The palm trees and billiard table have been shipped in, work on the infinity pool overlooking the coral reef is progressing and the tennis courts are celebrity-ready. But few of the super-luxury buildings rising on Moskito island's beaches are finished yet.\nMoskito is Sir Richard Branson's number two Caribbean island, but it will soon be his new family complex. It is just over a mile from Necker island, which he bought in his 20s for £250,000 and now rents for £40,000 a night.\nBoth islands are eco-trophies for Britain's best-known entrepreneur, but his plans to ditch the use of diesel power and to generate electricity from wind and solar are expected to have a profound impact on dozens of far poorer nearby islands facing crippling debt, hurricanes and climate change.\nLast week Branson hosted a summit of financiers, politicians, energy companies, lawyers and others on Moskito and Necker to work up a plan to \"green\" the Caribbean, island by island. Five prime ministers and 12 governments, as well as international bankers and investors, heard renewable energy experts explain how the region's islands, which currently generate nearly all their electricity from diesel, could save hundreds of millions of dollars a year and reduce emissions by 50% or more.\nNecker and Moskito will be 75-80% converted to use renewable energy and become working models for how other islands could cut expensive diesel imports, while all Caribbean governments will be offered a technical and financial blueprint on how to switch, by US energy thinktank the Rocky Mountain Institute and Branson's green business group, Carbon War Room.\nSo far the governments of Aruba, St Lucia, the British Virgin Islands, St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, the Turks and Caicos, Dominica and the Colombian islands of Providencia and San Andrés have said that they will aim to increase their use of renewable energy and cut diesel imports. Last week the US government's private-sector lending arm said it would support the efforts by the islands to go green by offering loans of up to $250m for renewable energy and energy-saving projects.\n\"This is personal and global. Moskito is now our family home. We know that islands will suffer the most from climate change and sea-level rise. Reefs will be devastated, and wildlife decimated,\" Branson told the Observer in an interview. \"It's realistic to think that whole islands could be 75-80% clean energy in four to five years. It might not make sense to do the last 25%, but they all ought to be able to go 75-80% using wind and solar energy.\n\"Governments [here] need help. I think a lot of ministers may be new to the job; they can't be experts at climate or energy. Some need a helping hand to make the transition to renewables. We can really save families 40% of what they have to pay for electricity,\" he said.\nThe irony of a man whose rail and airline companies are significant climate polluters trying to \"green\" small island states is not lost on Caribbean governments. Branson said it has led him to invest heavily in green fuels, solar panels and other \"clean-tech\" developments. \"There is no question that Virgin is involved in a number of businesses that emit a lot of carbon, and that is one of the reasons why I have to work particularly hard … but, more importantly, to try to help other people balance their books as well,\" he said.\nHowever, he said he has lost many millions of pounds in failed green investments. \"We have invested hundreds of millions in clean technology projects. We haven't made hundreds of millions profit.\n\"We had to write off a $50m investment in [US solar panel manufacturer] Solyndra in 2011. We went in with the best of intentions. The thing was that the price of solar had collapsed in China. So from a global perspective it could be said to be positive. We got in quite early. Pioneers can always come a cropper, like Freddie Laker. They often pave the way for others. But we are still standing, and investing.\"\nBranson's investments in cleaner aviation fuel continue, but are nowhere near ready to scale up for commercial use. Peak oil – the expected point of maximum global oil production before it starts to decline – and a widely predicted hike in fuel prices have not happened and, if anything, he said, the world should expect the oil price to fall rather than rise in the next few years because of fracking. Branson said he has high hopes for LanzaTech, a company that has pioneered a way to turn carbon-rich waste gases from aluminium producers and other industrial plants into biofuels. According to Virgin Atlantic, the fuel has the potential to cut aviation emissions by 60% compared with conventional fuels and could produce enough biofuel to meet 19% of global demand for aviation fuel. \"We still need a clean aviation fuel, though. It will take a while longer. But we know it works,\" he said.\nBritish author Tom Bower calculated in his new book, Branson, Behind the Mask, that the entrepreneur had lost $300m in failed green investments and used the British Virgin Islands to hide his accounts in a succession of 11 companies. \"He, most unusually, invested his own money and has lost most of it; and all his claims have proved to be wrong – namely: peak oil, oil prices, Virgin's use of alternative fuels and the potential profits,\" Bower said. The author accused Branson of not understanding the science or human costs of biofuels, and latching on to green businesses for political motives and profit, rather than for environmental reasons. \"He embraced environmentalism and aligned himself with Clinton and Gore, to get on the top table of US and British politics,\" said Bower.\nBranson shrugs off the criticisms, saying he has been an active environmentalist since his student hippy days and that, rather than him using the environment to get to politicians, it is more a case of politicians using him.\nTony Blair, Al Gore, Bill Clinton and other politicians have visited Necker, but not David Cameron, whom Branson strongly supports for his commitment to nuclear power. \"I would say he is doing his best. I think they are trying to meet [emission] targets. Cameron has been brave with nuclear, from a global point of view. Germany backtracking on nuclear is worrying. Nuclear has got safer and safer; we can now use waste products of nuclear,\" he said. \"If you accept that the globe has a major problem [with emissions], then you can't leave nuclear out of the equation. I have studied how many people have been killed in nuclear accidents – it's less than 1,000.\n\"One Chinese coalmine disaster can kill more than that. If you have a global catastrophe, you have to take extreme measures. Nuclear seems to be an important weapon that the world has.\"\nMore controversially, along with billionaires such as Bill Gates, Branson supports the idea of high-risk, quick technological fixes to \"geo-engineer\" the global climate if emissions were to get out of control. This could involve sucking carbon out of the air or spraying millions of tonnes of reflective particles of sulphur dioxide 30 miles above the Earth to cool it. \"I call it re-engineering,\" he said. \"There's a subtle difference, trying to re-engineer the world back to roughly where it is today. It's controversial, but we would be mad not to look at the technologies. If there are any risks attached, it would need the UN to decide whether the risk is worth taking … hopefully it won't be necessary. Hopefully we can come up with something more mundane than the radical answer.\"\nBranson said the environment is now his overriding preoccupation. He is seeking to set up a Caribbean-wide marine zone where no sharks are killed, and has lobbied heavily for a marine park around Australia. He is also involved in protecting wildlife in Africa. \"I find it interests me a lot more than making a few more bucks; it's much more satisfactory. I enjoyed building companies, but I find this more rewarding.\"",

It pledged to invest €600m (£471m) in renewable energy projects – in addition to an earlier €1.5bn (£1.2bn) cash injection – and a further €400m (£314m) to support communities vulnerable to climate change.\nThe world’s biggest furniture retailer says it’s going “all in” to have a net positive impact on the climate through renewable energy investment, energy-efficiency measures, cutting supply chain emissions, and product changes designed to achieve behaviour change. It has already helped its suppliers become 18% more energy efficient over the past four years – through the introduction of a sustainability assessment tool and by bringing suppliers together to share sustainability best practice.\nRelated: Can you power a business on 100% renewable energy? Ikea wants to try\nAt COP21, the firm lobbied for stronger action, largely through We Mean Business, a coalition of global companies and investors who are committed to the green agenda. It also co-founded RE100, a campaign that now has more than 50 of the world’s biggest companies committed to the transition to 100% renewable electricity.\nIkea plans to be a net exporter of renewable energy within four years. The retailer currently produces 53% of its energy from renewable sources: it operates 314 wind turbines and has installed 700,000 solar panels on its stores and distribution centres. In some countries – such as Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Poland – the retailer already produces energy equivalent to what it uses in its operations. In Canada, its wind farm produces more than double its consumption.\nSupporting consumers to make environmental choices is another core part of Ikea’s strategy. The firm switched its entire lighting range to LED in September and estimates that by 2020 the change will have saved electricity equivalent to the annual needs of every household in London and Paris.\nIkea is the 2016 winner of the net positive category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards.",

        "conteudo": "The commitment by both major parties to new coalmines that threaten the Great Barrier Reef was “the great tragedy” of Australian politics, Greens leader Richard di Natale told the ABC’s Q&A program on Monday.\nDi Natale, who was forced to defend the role of his party from both Labor and Coalition rivals, who branded him “arrogant”, linked fossil fuel donations to the two major parties to the economic woes now felt in regions like central Queensland.\nPressed by an audience member on how the Greens would boost the economy in former mining boom towns, Di Natale jumped on an earlier answer from Coalition MP Steve Ciobo that the government was banking partly on the huge Carmichael mine.\n“I tell you what we won’t be doing is opening up a new coalmine and killing the Great Barrier Reef,” Di Natale said to applause from the Brisbane audience.\n“If you care about tourism you don’t open up a whopping great big coalmine and fuel catastrophic global warming.\nRelated: Environment scorecard rates Coalition's policies 'woefully inadequate'\n“But this is the great tragedy here in Australia right now, is we’ve got the two old parties committed to opening up new coalmines and preventing this country from realising the huge opportunities that come with making a transition to the clean, renewable energy economy.”\nDi Natale said both the Coalition and Labor were complicit in “slashing” the renewable energy target and funding to the renewable energy agency, with “no strategy” to develop renewable sector investment to the point where it could deliver “100,000 jobs” as in Germany, denying new employment opportunities to regional Australia.\n“And if you want to know why those communities you spoke about are in such trouble, look no further than the massive donations that have been given to both the old parties from the fossil fuel lobby,” Di Natale said, again to applause.\nDi Natale, a day after an election leaders’ debate he declared a “snoozefest”, came under repeated attack from Ciobo and Labor MP Terri Butler.\nButler, who said she personally did not support the Carmichael mine and that the state Labor government did not “have much discretion” around its approval, told Di Natale: “It’s great you have a good policy, Richard, it’s absolutely fantastic.\nMost Australians don’t identify with Greens policies. They … actually want strong border sovereignty,\nSteve Ciobo\n“But we have a fantastic policy and we can form government and deliver it. That’s the difference between Labor and the Greens,” Butler said.\n“Not for long,” Di Natale replied, to which Butler said: “No, no, this is serious – this is actually serious,” before referring to Labor’s plan for a 50% renewables target by 2030, $500m in reef water quality funding and skills and training investment for a “just transition” in post-mining communities.\nAsked by host Tony Jones about the “existential threat” to the reef, and the Flinders university estimate that $10bn in funding over 10 years was needed to save it, Ciobo defended the Coalition’s $460m to improve water quality and its carbon pollution reduction scheme that would achieve “one of the highest per capita reductions in the world”.\nCiobo also pointed to skills and training funding, international tourism and agribusiness as the way for mining dependent communities to make a transition, but said global coal demand was “going through the roof”.\nDi Natale retorted: “That’s why the coal price is tanking.”\nCiobo accused Di Natale, by calling for a moratorium on new mines in Australia, of exporting the production of coal.\n“That’s not going to save the reef, mate, it might make you feel good, but it’s not actually going to make a difference,” he said.\nSouth Australian senator and new party leader Nick Xenophon confessed he did not know the answer to reviving struggling mining communities, but said: “We blew the mining boom.\n“We should have had a sovereign wealth fund. We should have been able to cushion ourselves from these shocks.”\nTasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie – whose other notable contribution was a call for young adults not working or studying to be conscripted into military service – questioned Di Natale’s reference to Germany’s renewables sector. Lambie said the country paid “double” what Australians did for electricity and relied on France’s nuclear energy for its “baseload” power. Di Natale disputed this.\nYou do not have the capacity to become the PM after the federal election\nTerri Butler to Richard Di Natale\nThe Greens leader and Xenophon were both upbraided by Ciobo – with agreement from Butler – as “really arrogant” in their attitudes to the major parties, whom Di Natale branded the “Coles and Woolies” of politics.\n“Richard, most Australians don’t identify with Greens policies. They’re not in favour of legalising drugs … they actually want strong border sovereignty,” Ciobo said.\n“And that’s the reason why they will support the Labor party or the Liberal party in stronger numbers than they will your party.\n“And mate, you can sit there and be arrogant about it and say well that’s just because they’re not that smart, but I mean the reality is, mate, the reason they get behind the majors is because of those common values.”\nButler told Di Natale he had been excluded from the leaders’ debate “because you do not have the capacity to become the PM after the federal election”.\n“People have got a serious choice to make here: a choice between a government who’s going to make big cuts to services and hand over money to foreign investors and big corporations, and someone else who’s actually got capacity to do real work and save the reef,” Butler said.\nDi Natale, the only panel member to attract regular applause, said the “identity politics” that helped Labor and the Coalition was breaking down and that “our time is coming”.\n“If there was a vote among people who are under 30 in Australia there’d possibly be a Greens prime minister,” he said.\nRelated: Deal and no deal: decoding Turnbull and Shorten's double talk on minority rule | Lenore Taylor\nCiobo said it was “quite fascinating to watch Terri and Richard bicker because what’s fascinating about this election is that the Labor party know they are in serious strife because [the Greens] obviously appeal to the centre left”.\nHe said Labor was “completely split down the guts” on asylum policy and Di Natale was “excited” at the prospect of the Greens winning lower house votes on the issue.\nDi Natale’s response again won him applause.\n“I know this is really hard to believe, but I don’t care what the Labor party thinks about this issue,” he said.\n“I care about those kids who are rotting in hellholes in those offshore camps because we’ve got a Liberal government and a Labor party who haven’t got the courage to stand up and say these are people who are going to make a contribution to this country.\n“And a decent society doesn’t take innocent people and harm them – and we know they’re being harmed – to send a message to someone else.”",

Conversely, those only featuring a small part of the picture can be accused of being too simplistic.\nThe 2009 film, Lessons of the Loess Plateau, looked at the large-scale environmental restoration project undertaken in northern China. The documentary shows how the stark and dusty wasteland was transformed into a luscious agricultural landscape. Pragmatic and results-focused communications are compelling – the film shows the huge potential of environmental restoration – but with such a complex issue, perhaps a variety of approaches should be used.\nSo what are the most effective ways to present climate solutions? Is it time to change the language used in climate campaigns?

        "conteudo": "The UK renewable energy industry has warned the government’s new climate secretary that she will face a legal challenge if she oversees the “wilful destruction” of the industry by retrospectively curtailing subsidies.\nLater this week, the Department of Energy and Climate Change will announce that the existing subsidy scheme for onshore wind power will be closed a year earlier than it was due to, according to a source close to the process.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAmber Rudd, secretary of state for energy and climate change. Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/Rex Shutterstock\nSuch a move would be a major blow to the industry and go further than the Conservative party had pledged in its manifesto. It had said that it would “end any new public subsidy” in a bid to “halt the spread of onshore windfarms”.\nBut writing in the Guardian on Monday, a lawyer for the trade body RenewableUK called on Amber Rudd to reconsider – or face legal challenges.\n“Minister, please talk to us before you act. We recognise the pressures on you. There are solutions which need not damage confidence in the UK or in your government as one for all of us and not just for a few dangerous, ill-informed and visibly rabid party members,” wrote Marcus Trinick QC, a barrister for law firm Partner Eversheds LLP.\nRelated: Amber Rudd, don't destroy the wind power industry\n“Please be aware of the dangers of [EU] state aid discrimination and look at what is happening in international energy arbitration across Europe. In such a position we could not afford not to fight, especially if action is taken to interfere retrospectively,” he added.\nIf the Renewable Obligation (RO) subsidy scheme closes in April 2016 rather than April 2017, as is now expected, onshore windfarms will have to bid for public subsidy under a new subsidy regime known as Contracts for Difference (CfD).\nBut it is not yet clear if they will even be eligible for the CfD scheme, and Bloomberg Energy Finance has estimated that if onshore wind was not eligible then less than half the capacity of projects in advanced stages of planning would get subsidies.\nMaf Smith, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK, vowed to fight the move which he said would appear to contradict the Tory pledge that cuts would only be to new, not existing, subsidies.\n“The industry will fight against any attempts to bring in drastic and unfair changes utilising the full range of options open, including legal means if appropriate,” he said.\nIan Marchant, chairman of Infinis Energy Plc and former chief executive of Big Six energy company SSE, warned that closing the subsidy scheme early for onshore wind would have wider ramifications: “If the RO is terminated early without reasonable grace periods in place, not a single energy or large scale infrastructure project in the UK will be safe going forward.”\nDr Rob Gross, an energy expert at Imperial College, said that it was not fair to suggest the RO was hugely over-rewarding onshore wind with too much public subsidy.\n“I think this is mainly about the manifesto commitment and being seen to do something to curtail the development of onshore wind. It’s primarily a politically-motivated change,” he told the Guardian.\nRudd said in statement that: “We promised people clean, affordable and secure energy supplies and that’s what I’m going to deliver. We’ll focus support on renewables when they’re starting up - getting a good deal for billpayers is the top priority.” A Decc spokeswoman added: “It’s premature to talk about retrospective changes [to subsidy regimes].”\nThe government has already laid out the other part of its crackdown on onshore windfarms, using the Queen’s speech to announce that the energy bill will give local communities an effective veto over new ones. Onshore wind is considered by most authorities to be the cheapest form of renewable power in the UK.",

        "conteudo": "The UK's top marine scientists have denounced government ministers for reneging on plans to protect marine life by banning the most destructive fishing and dredging in the seas around the British Isles.\nSealife, including fish, lobsters, oysters and seahorses, has been in rapid decline for years. A two-year, £8m consultation involving thousands of people and the government's own scientific advisers concluded that 127 marine protection zones (MPZs) were needed to halt the decline. But the environment minister, Richard Benyon rejected this advice, proposing instead to establish just 31 MPZs, none of which would be completely protected.\nThe issue is one of a series in which environment ministers have been attacked for rejecting scientific advice, including its proposed badger cull, described as \"mindless\" by the architect of a landmark £20m culling study, and its refusal to suspend the use of pesticides linked to serious harm in bees against the advice of the European Food Safety Authority.\nNow 86 environmental academics have written to Benyon, David Cameron and the environment secretary, Owen Paterson urging them to beef up their plans for protection.\n\"We have seen spectacular devastation in the Irish sea in the last 20 years, for example, due to scallop dredging and prawn trawling. As fish stocks get ever more squeezed, the use of ever more destructive gear is spreading. This is happening now and protection is long overdue,\" said Professor Callum Roberts, at the University of York and one of the experts. \"Even if all 31 MPZs were established, it will fall far short of what is needed to recover and safeguard English seas. The process has been seriously mishandled, potentially condemning the marine environment to many more years of overexploitation and degradation.\"\nRoberts said: \"There is a strong suspicion among my colleagues that the government has yielded to political pressure from the fishing industry, in effect handing them control over a process that was meant to be democratic and inclusive.\"\nThe letter was signed by five of the eight scientists on a panel set up by ministers that backed the 127 MPZs. But Benyon hit back directly, saying those scientists \"actually sat on the panel that told us there was not enough evidence to designate all 127 sites. This is not a numbers game and it is not about just drawing lines on a map - it would have been easy for me to do that and we would have ended up sitting in an EU court room defending the fact we created MPZs without the science to back them up.\"\nPreviously, Benyon defended his decision by citing the economic importance of fisheries, sand and gravel dredging, and marine renewable energy, and saying: \"It is proportionate and is not going to put anyone out of business.\"\nBut Roberts rejected Benyon's \"spin\", telling the Guardian that the scientific panel never said there was insufficient evidence. \"Using the best available evidence is an essential element of the precautionary principle, whereby we should act now to prevent further harm and to begin the process of recovery rather than wait for better data, by which time it may be too late.\"\nJean-Luc Solandt, from the Marine Conservation Society, said: \"In its cut-down form, there will be no real network and the opportunity to give English marine life the protection it desperately needs will be missed. In a time of economic gloom, we actually have an opportunity to bring back the wealth that productive, well cared-for seas have to offer.\" But ministers were being timid and failing to show any green credentials, he said.\nSea creatures at risk without new protection include native oysters, black bream, spiny lobsters, lagoon sand shrimps and short snouted seahorses, according to Solandt. The Wildlife Trusts are also \"bitterly disappointed by the lack of ambition\" from ministers. It warned that iconic sites such as Flamborough and Studland and a unique chalk reef at Cromer were missing from the government's list.\nThe letter from scientists, made public on Monday, said: \"In 2010, your government committed to creating 'an ecologically coherent network' of areas [to] protect and recover the richness and productivity of our waters.\" It calls on ministers to re-commit to establishing all 127 MPZs.\nBenyon said: \"Rather than jumping on the bandwagon and lobbying government, I would ask these scientists to focus their attention on gathering more evidence so we can designate more sites in the future.\"\nBut Tom Harris, Labour's shadow environment minister said: \"There is mounting frustration over the agonisingly slow pace of reform under this government. The minister has contradicted his own scientific advice by using the need for more evidence within a minority of sites to justify a drastic cut in the overall number of MPZs.\"\nPaul Trebilcock, chairman of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: \"We are very concerned that some nature conservation groups are lobbying for full implementation of all 127 sites, regardless of scientific evidence or the socio-economic impact. We are absolutely adamant that naive enthusiasm should not railroad the government into premature and hasty decisions.\"",

        "conteudo": "Update: Two verdicts of guilty, one not guilty: that was the conclusion of the mock ecocide trial (details below) held at the UK's supreme court on 30 September. Real lawyers, judges and a public jury found the CEOs of fictional fossil fuel companies guilty of \"extensive destruction, damage to or loss of ecosystem(s) to such an extent that the peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants of that territory, and of other territories, has been severely diminished\", as a result of their company's extraction of oil from tar sands in Canada. The jury found one of the CEOs not guilt on the count of damage caused by an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\nPolly Higgins, the driving force behind the trial and who is working to have ecocide join genocide and three other crimes against peace in the UN, said: \"For me the trial was a moment of truth. No longer is it acceptable to pursue profit without consequence. Corporate Ecocide is a global crime that is far greater and far more prevalent that most people realise. Those few people who dare to speak up about Corporate Ecocide in Wall Street have been arrested for speaking out about a greater crime, a far greater breach of the peace than their own shouting and campaigning. Surely it is now the time to prosecute the true destroyers of our world.\"\nShe added: \"I'm not keen to see lots of [people] in the dock. What I want to see is people making responsible decisions. For example, a crime of ecocide could force governments to change the incentive structures for businesses by redirecting subsidises for fossil fuels towards clean energy sources. In this way the dirty energy companies that are wrecking the environment today could be transformed into the clean energy companies of tomorrow.\"\nOriginal story (29/09/11): It's a grim list: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression (such as unprovoked invasions) and war crimes. All are recognised by the UN as crimes against peace and prosecuted through the international criminal court.\nBut should the bosses of polluting companies and the leaders of environmentally-unfriendly states join those responsible for mass murder in the dock. They could if a fifth crime against peace - ecocide - joined that list of human evils? The United Nations is now considering the proposal and the first test of how a prosecution for ecocide would work takes place on Friday, with fossil fuel bosses in the dock at the UK supreme court in London. It is a mock trial of course, but with real top-flight lawyers and judges and a jury made up of members of the public. The corporate CEOs will be played by actors briefed by their legal teams.\nThe crime of ecocide is the brainchild of British lawyer Polly Higgins, who in her UN submission defined it as:\nEcocide: The extensive damage, destruction to or loss of ecosystems of a given territory, whether by human agency or by other causes, to such an extent that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants of that territory has been severely diminished.\nCrimes being considered for prosecution in Friday's trial include the extraction of oil from Canada's tar sands, a major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, fracking for shale gas in Nigeria and bauxite mining of Niyamgiri mountain, India. The real world parallels are not accidental, I'm sure.\nAn international law against ecocide, enforceable in the UK, will be assumed for the purposes of the mock trial. But there is no script and the jury's verdict is theirs alone to decide. \"It is nerve-racking, it is not a done deal,\" says Higgins.\nShe argues the link between ecocide and genocide is that damage and destruction to the environment depletes the Earth's resources, which leads to conflict. Only by making ecocide a crime for which individuals can be jailed, will we change the norm which allows profit to be put before the planet, she told me.\nHiggins says a key inspiration is William Wilberforce, whose campaigning led to the abolition of slavery in the UK. He changed to norm of how black people were treated, she says, and ecocide law would change the way the planet is treated. \"We have go to the point when the ethical imperative trumps the economic imperative,\" she says. At the moment in many countries, she points out, the first responsibility of CEOs is a financial one to their shareholders. If environmental destruction is not illegal but can boost profit, it will happen, she says.\nBut she is not anti-corporate or anti-profit, she says: \"I started as a corporate lawyer. Now I want to make the problem part of the solution.\" She says companies should be making profits from solving the problems of global warming, habitat destruction and the extinctions of animals and plants. The companies that traded in slaves did not go out of business after slavery was abolished, she claims.\nI asked her about the problem of proving causation between the acts of companies and environmental damage, which has doomed previous attempted prosecutions in the US.\n\"Genocide is a crime of intent, but ecocide is not,\" she says. An ecocide law would create a pre-emptive responsibility to prevent ecological damage, she explains, in the same way that \"superior responsibility\" or \"strict liablility\" enables people to be prosecuted whether or not they intended to cause damage. \"I am really not wanting to see lots of CEOs locked up,\" she says, but wants them deterred from ecocide in the first place.\nI also asked her about the phrase in her ecocide definition that says \"whether by human agency or by other causes\". If there is a natural disaster, who can be prosecuted? The \"other causes\" term is there, she says, to place an obligation on governments to intervene in disasters to minimise damage.\nIf this all seems utter fantasy to you, it is worth noting that Bolivia has already passed laws granting all nature equal rights to humans. Furthermore, ecocide could become an international crime by amendment of the ICC's Statute of Rome, which would need 86 nations to back it. Are there 86 states backing the ICC who feel climate change, the crisis in the oceans and other environmental problems are trashing their \"peaceful enjoyment\" of the Earth's bounty? I wouldn't be surprised if there were.\nUpdate (11:22 Friday): The two crimes chosen for the ecocide mock trial are the extraction of oil from Canada's tar sands, a major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. I'll update the post again when the verdict comes.\nNote: The trial, organised by the Hamilton Group, begins at 0900 BST on Friday 30 September and will be broadcast live by Sky News's Supreme Court web channel.

Test your green-energy IQ and learn some surprising truths about the state of sunshine-based electricity in America.\nMonday 23 June 2008 19.12 EDT\nThe sun shines high above a cluster of palms. Photograph: Andy Newman/AFP/Getty Images\n1. Solar power is often considered too expensive to be an efficient energy alternative. What is the price difference between electricity from fossil fuels and that from a thin-film solar panel?\na. Coal-burning power is $1.50 cheaper for every watt\nb. Coal-burning power is $2.23 cheaper for every watt\nc. Solar power is 9 cents/watt cheaper\nd. Coal-burning power is about 86 cents cheaper, but projected to become more expensive by 2010\n2. The US national tax credit for solar power expires at the end of 2008. Which of the following have Democrats NOT proposed to help pay for renewable energy credits?\na. Cutting subsidies to private security contractors in Iraq\nb. Cutting subsidies to big oil and gas companies\nc. Ending a tax break that benefits wealthy hedge fund managers\nd. Delaying the future implementation of a new tax break for multinational corporations\n3. The average solar power cell harnesses what percentage of the total energy contained in sunlight?\na. Between 6% and 12%, depending on the material\nb. At least 30%\nc. 9.9% was the best solar efficiency level ever recorded\nd. Between 25% and 32%, depending on the material\n4. There are two types of solar power: photovoltaic (PV), which uses thin cells to capture sunlight, and thermal, which uses sunlight to heat up a turbine that then generates electricity. Which system pays for itself faster in the average US home?\na. PV pays for itself in a year, but thermal can take up to 15 years\nb. PV takes 6-12 years to become cost-saving, depending on the size of the cell installation, while thermal takes slightly less\nc. Thermal takes 6-12 years to become cost-saving, depending on the size of the turbine, while PV takes slightly less\nd. PV and thermal both take 8-10 years to become cost-saving\n5. The ultimate goal of solar-power advocates is “grid parity”. What does this term mean?\na. The amount of solar-based electricity entering the worldwide power grid is equal to that coming from fossil fuel-burning plants\nb. The worldwide power grid has as much transmission space dedicated to solar as it does to traditionally generated electricity\nc. The price of using solar power is equal to that of electricity generated from fossil fuels\nd. No new coal-burning electricity plants are needed, because new solar installations are fully meeting the world’s energy demands\n6. Fill in the blank in this sentence: The amount of energy in ______ of direct sunlight striking the earth would fuel worldwide energy consumption for one year.\na. 24 hours\nc. 5 minutes\nd. 1 week\n7. Many people who lack the space or income to install their own solar panels may be unaware that they can purchase renewably generated electricity from their everyday utility company. More than 800 American utility companies offer consumers that option – but what percentage of Americans take advantage of it, according to the National Renewable Energy Lab?\na. 15%",

        "conteudo": "As you travel along the drive to James Lovelock's house, located in a remote, wooded valley on the Cornwall-Devon border, you pass a sign by a gated cattle grid. \"Experimental station,\" it reads. \"Site of a new natural habitat. Please do not trespass or disturb.\"\nThirty years ago, Lovelock planted 20,000 trees to create the much more biodiverse habitat around his home. But you suspect that, had this fiercely independent scientist and globally respected environmental thinker been around 3.8 billion years ago when life first erupted on this planet, he would have organised a similar notice to be placed somewhere prominent.\nAfter all, Lovelock – now into his 90s but still fit enough to be invited aboard Richard Branson's soon-to-launch commercial spacecraft – is the man who first developed the \"Gaia theory\" in the late 1960s: the still-challenging idea that Earth is one giant, self-regulating organism whose equilibrium is being very much disturbed by the actions of one species. Lovelock has been warning with increasing urgency that the survival of that species – Homo sapiens – is now gravely threatened by the \"Revenge of Gaia\", the title of one of his more recent bestselling books.\nHe is billed as an Old Testament-style prophet for our times, predicting fire and brimstone for a damned generation if it does not urgently and radically change its polluting ways. But in person Lovelock has a becalming presence, even when firing off verbal thunderbolts at the various \"dumbos\" with whom we have bestowed our collective fate: namely, \"the politicians, scientists and lobbyists\".\nThe past four months, he says, have only hardened his disdain for this grouping; a turbulent period that has seen efforts to tackle climate change undermined by the online release of the hacked University of East Anglia emails, the failure of the Copenhagen climate conference, the (forced) admission by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that its latest report contained some minor mistakes, and the onset of an exceptionally cold winter across some parts of the northern hemisphere.\nLeaning back into his swivel chair in his modest office-cum-laboratory, from where he writes and conducts the odd commissioned experiment for the Ministry of Defence and MI5 (\"it's nothing that interesting; just health-and-safety work\", he says when probed for more detail), Lovelock directs his first wave of ire at the reports that climate scientists had been caught up in the email scandal. He was, he says, \"utterly disgusted\" when he first heard about the allegations. (He didn't read the actual emails when they were posted online, adding that: \"Oddly, I felt reluctant to pry.\")\nDuring this discussion, Lovelock recalls the \"corruption of science\" that occurred during the attempts to link chlorofluorocarbons with the hole in the ozone layer in the 1980s. \"Fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the holy ghost of science. I'm not religious, but I put it that way because I feel so strongly. It's the one thing you do not ever do.\"\nLovelock says the events of the past few months have seen him warm to the efforts of some climate sceptics: \"What I like about sceptics is that in good science you need critics that make you think: 'Crumbs, have I made a mistake here?' If you don't have that continuously, you really are up the creek.\n\"The good sceptics have done a good service – but some of the mad ones, I think, have not done anyone any favours. Some, of course, are corrupted and employed by oil companies and things like that. Some even work for governments. For example, I wouldn't put it past the Russians to be behind some of the disinformation to help further their energy interests. But you need sceptics, especially when the science gets very big and monolithic.\"\nAnd the sceptics are right, he says, to be deeply distrustful of scientists who are overly reliant on computer models, particularly when it comes to predicting future climate scenarios: \"We're not that bright an animal. We stumble along very nicely and it's amazing what we do do sometimes, but we tend to be too hubristic to notice the limitations. If you make a model, after a while you get suckered into it. You begin to forget that it's a model and think of it as the real world.\"\nIt is obvious, both from talking to Lovelock and reading his work, particularly his most recent books, that he doesn't have the highest opinion of mankind's capabilities to see the long game and act accordingly.\n\"I don't think we're yet evolved to the point where we're clever enough to handle as complex a situation as climate change,\" he responds, when asked whether we are up to the task as a species of tackling climate change. \"We're very active animals. We like to think, 'Ah yes, this will be a good policy,' but it's almost never that simple. Wars show this to be true. People are very certain they are fighting a just cause, but it doesn't always work out like that. Climate change is kind of a repetition of a wartime situation. It could quite easily lead to a physical war.\"\nHopelessness is a response, one senses, never far from a Lovelock audience. He is not one to toss around crumbs of comfort when he believes they're not justified, and displays a great deal of contempt for what he believes to be the naive idealism and ideologies of much of the current environmental movement – a significant proportion of which still looks up to him with a certain reverence. For example, it was his high-profile switch a few years ago to promoting nuclear energy as the best hope for saving ourselves that helped convince many environmentalists to rethink their instinctive opposition to this technology. Now, he says, he is not convinced that any meaningful response to \"global heating\", as he likes to call it, can be achieved from within the modern democracies of the western world.\n\"We need a more authoritative world,\" he says resolutely. \"We've become a sort of cheeky, egalitarian world where everyone can have their say. It's all very well, but there are certain circumstances – a war is a typical example – where you can't do that. You've got to have a few people with authority who you trust who are running it. They should be very accountable too, of course – but it can't happen in a modern democracy. This is one of the problems.\n\"What's the alternative to democracy? There isn't one. But even the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches, democracy must be put on hold for the time being. I have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while.\"\nBut with public confidence in climate science taking such a knock in recent months, what will it take to convince the public that urgent action really is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – or, as is Lovelock's preference, to adapt and prepare the lifeboat for a changing climate?\n\"There has been a lot of speculation that a very large glacier in Antarctica is unstable,\" he says, referring to Pine Island glacier or \"the Pig\", as the scientists now monitoring it like to call it. \"If there's much more melting, it may break off and slip into the ocean. I'd say the scientists are not worried about it, but they are keeping a close watch on it. It would be enough to produce an immediate sea level rise of two metres – something huge. And tsunamis. That would be the sort of event that would change public opinion – or a return of the dustbowl in the American midwest. Another IPCC report won't be enough; we'll just argue over it like now.\"\n(I later contact Dr Robert Bindschadler, the Nasa scientist who leads the team monitoring the Pig. \"No one expects full collapse of the system as quickly as [in the next] 100 years,\" Bindschadler responds, \"'but even if it did, the mean rate of sea level rise would 'only' triple the current rate of rise. No one would get their feet wet overnight.\")\nOn a noticeboard behind Lovelock hangs a photograph of a huge wind turbine. As an active anti-wind farm campaigner, does it infuriate him that so much investment is now being poured into renewable energy infrastructure? \"I've always said that adaptation is the most serious thing we can do,\" he says. \"Are our sea defences adequate? Can we prevent London from flooding? This is where we should be spending our billions. If wind turbines really worked, I wouldn't object to them. To hell with the aesthetics, we might need them to save ourselves. But they don't work – the Germans have admitted it.\n\"It's like the Common Agricultural Policy, which led to corruption and inefficiencies. A common energy policy across Europe is not a good idea. I'm in favour of nuclear for crowded places like Britain for the simple reason that it's cheap, effective and exceedingly safe when you look at the record.\"\nHis views on carbon emissions trading, as is being touted by the EU and others, are equally dismissive: \"I don't know enough about carbon trading, but I suspect that it is basically a scam. The whole thing is not very sensible. We have this crazy idea that we are setting an example to the world. What we're doing is trying to make money out of the world by selling them renewable gadgetry and green ideas. It might be worthy from the national interest, but it is moonshine if you think what the Chinese and Indians are doing [in terms of emissions]. The inertia of humans is so huge that you can't really do anything meaningful.\"\nLovelock freely admits that, at 90, he won't be around to see the results of the \"experiment\" humans are currently conducting with the atmosphere. It's what, in part, gives him the licence to speak with such frankness. But for anyone younger, Lovelock's prognosis for our species is hard to hear, let alone accept. That a black, rain-laden cloud is welling up over the nearby moorland as I set off to leave only acts to darken the mood.\nJames Lovelock will be speaking at the Southbank Centre in London tomorrow night (Tuesday) at 7.30pm (southbankcentre.co.uk)",

        "conteudo": "More than 10 years ago the European Space Agency (Esa) launched Rosetta with a plan to slingshot the spacecraft around Earth until it caught up with comet 67P, the final destination of a vessel meant to make human history in outer space. The spacecraft carried a lander, Philae, designed to touch down on the comet, but Philae’s landing did not go quite as planned.\nWhat was supposed to happen\nESA scientists hoped the comet would be a relatively even potato shape with plenty of flat surfaces suitable for landing on the 2.5-mile wide heap of ice, rock, dust and vapours, hurtling along at more than 11 miles per second. Rosetta’s controllers back on Earth tried to aim and time Philae’s release so that the comet’s weak gravity would slowly pull the lander to the site. Scientists had no control of Philae during its descent.\nNot far from the surface, controllers would order Philae’s thrusters to fire from on top of the lander, pushing Philae toward the comet. Once on the surface, they would send a command to shoot two harpoons from the lander into the comet’s crust, to prevent bouncing and secure it in place. The harpoons were also meant to counteract the plumes of gas and vapour that could knock Philae around, and will increasingly jet out of the comet as it approaches the sun.\nWith about 60 hours of battery life, Philae would start snapping photos and doing experiments, and although the comet’s path would occasionally take Agilkia into shadow, solar panels mounted on Philae could recharge the battery and keep the lander busy into March 2015.\nWhat did happen\nComet 67P turned out not to be shaped like a potato, as scientists hoped, and instead had an asymmetrical look “of a rubber duck”. Scientists identified Agilkia, a relatively open area about a third of a square mile as their best landing site, but had to manoeuvre Rosetta with thrusters for longer than expected to get it into the right spot for Philae’s drop.\nBefore releasing the lander, they discovered early on Wednesday morning that a key thruster designed to press Philae down onto the surface of the comet was not working. They decided to go ahead with the landing anyway and launched the probe from the Rosetta mother ship at 8.35am GMT.\nPhilae, rotating as it fell toward the surface, landed just about on target. The nitrogen thrusters failed, as expected, but the harpoons did not deploy, and in the extremely low gravity the lander bounced high up above the surface to a different location, where it bounced again. It took about two hours for Philae to settle after its initial touchdown. It came to rest around a kilometre from its intended landing site but the scientists are not yet sure exactly where.\nThe lander manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec, told the BBC:\nWe are still not anchored. We are sitting with the weight of the lander somehow on the comet. We are pretty sure where we landed the first time, and then we made quite a leap. Some people say it is in the order of one kilometre high. And then we had another small leap, and now we are sitting there, and transmitting, and everything else is something we have to start understanding and keep interpreting.\nPhilae has so far lost and regained contact with mission control as expected, but scientists don’t know where exactly the lander is; the pattern of radio signals is one of the ways they’re measuring the two bounces. The first photo ever taken from a comet’s surface shows crags and a rock face, suggesting the lander is either facing the rim of a crater, against a cliff or at the bottom of a hole.\nMission control says the lander is using solar energy, but “we’re getting one and a half hours of sunlight when we expected six or seven”. Philae’s variety of automated experiments have also begun, sending photos and data back through Rosetta to Esa.\n\">\nWhat they can try to fix it\nAlthough the landing gear was designed to “hop” Philae if necessary, it’s not clear whether ice screws on the lander’s legs have anchored the craft in such a way to make any movement feasible. A hop could topple the lander or shoot it up off the surface and away into space, as could an attempt to fire the harpoons.\nThe lander has drills as well, meant to investigate the comet, and scientists are weighing whether to deploy these drills – to secure or nudge the lander and gather data before the battery dies. But for every action there is a reaction, and drilling puts the probe at high risk of falling over.\nPhilae is “definitely not in the open”, the mission manager, Fred Jansen, told reporters, and if it’s stuck in a ditch then time is running out to perform experiments. With limited access to the sun, plans to use the lander for the next few months will have to change dramatically. Ulamec said the team will try to “modify the orientation” of the solar panels to get more sunlight, and that they’re changing Rosetta’s orbit to improve communication with Philae. Rosetta is also helping triangulate Philae’s location with a radar instrument called Consert.\nWhat if they can’t fix it\nThe mission goes on as long as it can. Even if Philae turns out to be wedged in a comet’s cranny, experiments on the comet’s gases and compounds will proceed powered by whatever energy the solar panels can provide.\nAs Dr Geraint Morgan explained to Open University, “we will sniff the comet no matter what happens” – meaning that the probe will still examine molecules drifting up from the surface. Many of the experiments are preprogrammed, and the Philae mission could help determine whether comets brought water to Earth, and whether they seeded our planet with chemical compounds (“organics”) that are the building blocks of life. Comets are ancient remnants of the solar system’s earliest moments, and even 60 hours of data could give a glimpse into what happened as the planets formed (or before they formed). The lander would have to drill to perform some of these experiments, but as time runs out the scientists will probably accept those risks.\nPhilae may fade beyond human contact in the next few days, but Rosetta will probably keep flying round its comet for two more years, even as the comet spews more and more water, dust and gas, burning up as its orbit (and Rosetta’s) get closer to the sun.",

        "conteudo": "As architecture design students we are taught to constantly question and reimagine the way things are. We’re taught that the world we live in is not a given. It’s the result of the best efforts our ancestors could muster at that time. If it has flaws, it is up to our generation to pick up where they left off and create the world we want to see for ourselves and our children.\nI’ve grown to understand that the society and culture I was born into is damaging the planet we live on at a greater scale than ever before. We put profit above people, economy above environment, progress above purpose. As a result, climate change has become the most important issue of our generation.\nBut it’s such a meaty, complex problem that we’re not sure how to approach it. It doesn’t seem to pose an immediate threat to our everyday lives, and most of us assume that there are surely some very clever scientists somewhere who will solve the problem for us.\nI became curious. If climate change is as big a threat as I’m being told, then my work as a designer and an architect should focus on helping address the issue. I wanted to really understand, in layman terms, what it is that’s causing our climate to warm. Why is a warmer climate dangerous? And how can I make a positive difference?\nI started by attending classes on sustainable design at my university. I spent a weekend in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to watch former US vice president Al Gore present his famous slide show and explain it in-depth at one of his “climate reality” workshops; I picked up a copy of Naomi Klein’s book This Changes Everything and downloaded as many climate-change related documentaries as I could get my hands on.\nWhy climate is your issue narrated by Naomi Klein\nSo what’s causing our climate to warm?\nFossil fuels: two words I’ve grown up hearing a lot. But until recently I couldn’t tell you exactly what a fossil fuel was. I just understood that every year we burn more and more to power our modern economy. It turns out a fossil fuel is simply a fossilised deposit of decayed, combustible plants and animals that has been buried below our earth for millions of years, then turned into coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels releases large quantities of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.\nWe live on a planet of more than 7 billion people. The volume of food and products we consume today is greater than ever before in human history. We’re not really aware of it in our daily lives, but the infrastructure that’s serving our needs, particularly here in the western world, has got completely out of control – often resulting in inexcusable levels of water and air pollution.\nWe seem to have reached a point where our human actions are creating damage to the environment at a greater rate and scale than most of us can comprehend.\nFinn Harries introduces the #GroundUp series\nSo these very human actions are causing our temperature to rise. Every month we are seeing worse storms, more wildfires and greater droughts than before. The science behind this is lengthy, but if you’re interested take a look at the Guardian’s ultimate climate change FAQ.\nAs I type these words, São Paulo, Brazil, New York and California are experiencing record levels of drought. In Bangladesh homes are being washed away by record-high water levels and in Greenland and Antarctica huge sheets of ice are breaking off and melting into the sea.\nThese climate impacts aren’t myth. They’re happening right now. Maybe the scariest realisation is that if we continue the way we are going, it is not our planet that will cease to exist but us. Rising sea levels, drought and storms will wipe us out in the hundreds of millions, taking thousands of animal species with us. We are risking everything we have by pursuing our obsessive drive for greater production and consumption at a completely unnecessary scale.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSeen through the teeth of a giant ‘Cuadzilla’, children stand behind a banner outside the gates of Didcot B power station as part of a protest against the fossil fuel industry by climate action group Reclaim The Power, Appleford, United Kingdom. 1st June 2015. Photograph: Mark Kerrison/Corbis\nSo that’s the reality. Now what? My first reaction was to put my head in the sand. However I refuse to accept the dismal future that lies ahead. As a result of our changing climate, we have a really unique opportunity to build a better future. As humans we’re innovative and adaptive. We’re able to recognise and rectify our mistakes.\nThe theme of prioritising profit above human suffering is not new. Before we exploited fossil fuels to run machines to do work for us we exploited other humans in the form of slavery. Only 200 years ago people argued that slavery was morally acceptable because it provided good, cheap energy that would help boost our global economy.\nOur forefathers recognised that inequity and changed that. Throughout history we’ve changed legislation, opinion and archaic systems to create a better world to live in.\nToday, as the most connected generation in history, we have the unique ability to create a future that embraces renewable technology; that democratises the way we produce and consume energy; that encourages sharing and responsible consumerism; and that provides jobs in new sectors focused on sustainable progress.\nWe’ve already seen Elon Musk build a billion-dollar electric car business he claims will be worth as much as Apple in a decade. We’ve seen hundreds of wind farms and solar parks pop up around the world. Costa Rica ran its entire country on renewable energy for 75 days this year by harnessing geothermal and hydroelectric power.\nThe responsibility now falls on our governments and large corporations to make ambitious, meaningful changes.\nJoin the call for divestment from fossil fuels\nLarge corporations and universities can start by divesting their investments from the fossil fuel industry. We’re already seeing many lead by example but there are so many more who can step up to the mark. As for our world leaders, in December they will come together in Paris to discuss the future of our planet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference.\nIf you’re reading this article, then you have access to the internet. You have the unique ability to voice your opinion. You have the free will and the power to make yourself heard and influence the decisions that will be made on your behalf at that conference. It doesn’t matter what country you live in, what colour your skin is, what gender or sexual orientation you are or what religion you believe in.\nThis affects every human on the planet. We are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the very last to be able to do anything about it.\nSo stand up, speak out and be part of a generation that is remembered for changing the course of human history to create a better planet to live on.\nFinn Harries blogs at JacksGap, an online blog and video project.

        "conteudo": "It’s been a tough year for brand USA. There was a horrific torture report, police violence against blacks, a dysfunctional Congress – and a troubled middle class. Even our fun and games are not as much fun as they used to be: just look at the NFL and its dismal record on brain damage and domestic violence.\nIn that context, corporate America had a good 2014. (Of course, in that context, just about everybody had a good 2014.) There was progress on the big issues that face big business, as well as the rest of us: climate change, food and forestry, labor rights in global supply chains and the circular economy.\nCorporates are stepping up to do their part. Collectively, they are not moving far enough and fast enough, but they are moving in the right direction. These days, that deserves two cheers, if not three.\nAmong the year’s highlights:\nClimate change policies drive cleantech\nHere was one exception to the rule that the federal government can’t get much done. Using his executive authority, President Obama imposed strong rules limiting climate pollution from coal plants, then traveled to Beijing where he and Chinese President Xi Jinxing pledged to curb their nations’ greenhouse gas emissions, albeit not for a while.\nTheir agreement led to the Lima Accord, a breakthrough in the sense that, for the first time, industrialized and emerging economies both promised to curb emissions. It’s unavoidably a voluntary approach to the climate crisis, and the emissions reductions that it generates may turn out to be too little too late. But as governments act, they will surely drive low-carbon innovation in rich and poor countries alike.\nThat’s where business comes in. As the costs of wind and solar energy continue to fall, corporate purchasing of clean energy is reaching new heights, creating a virtuous cycle where demand drives scale, which lowers prices, which then spurs more demand.\nDuring Climate Week in September, companies including IKEA, Swiss Re, Mars and BT, organized by the Climate Group, launched RE100, an initiative to encourage big companies to use 100% renewable power. That week, too, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, currently the world’s most valuable company, took a strong stand in favor of climate action. No longer can the US Chamber of Commerce or the fossil fuel industry claim to speak for all of American business.\nOne respected analyst, Shayle Kann of Greentech Media, says that by 2020, solar power will become cost competitive in more than half of the US, growing the solar market to 100 gigawatts—100 times larger than it is today. If it happens, that would be a game-changer.\nMore companies pay attention to farming and forestry supply chains\nIt’s no accident that big food companies like Unilever and Mars are sustainability leaders. Their global supply chains expose them to significant climate risks and resource constraints. Rising temperatures and falling water supplies, for example, threaten cacao growers in west Africa. So Mars is leading research to help farmers increase the quality and performance of cocoa plants, and better control pests and disease. Meanwhile, Unilever says all of its palm oil will be sustainably sourced by 2015.\nRetailers and food companies, meanwhile, are pushing sustainability programs down to the farm level. Walmart is working with 15 of its biggest suppliers to optimize fertilizer use and tilling practices in corn and soy farming. Field to Market, a broad coalition of growers, brands and retailers, is defining, measuring and advancing the sustainability of commodity crops. Under pressure from Oxfam America, General Mills and Kellogg promised to measure, publish and reduce emissions across their entire supply chains.\nLast fall, more than two dozen countries and as many companies also endorsed the New York Declaration on Forests, pledging to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030. A growing number of the world’s largest buyers of soy, palm oil and cattle have committed to exclude deforestation from their supply chains. Among them are such powerhouses as Asia Pulp & Paper, once a target of activists, and Cargill, which sells $135bn worth of commodities a year.\nFactories get safer\nEvery apparel company that did business in Bangladesh knew that factory conditions there were unsafe (and some had taken steps on their own to remedy problems), but it took the collapse of Rana Plaza, which killed approximately 1,100 workers in 2013, to spur the global garment industry to action.\nSince then, brands and retailers have organized a pair of coalitions – the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, backed primarily by European companies and labor unions, and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, a North American group – to inspect and, in some cases, remedy conditions at about 6,000 factories. Everyone involved in the effort says factories today are safer; no one will say they are safe enough.\nNo one tragedy spurred competitors like Apple, Microsoft, Google and HP to form the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition, but they, too, have strengthened industry-wide efforts to audit suppliers to protect workers (and the environment) in the developing world.\nThe circular economy grows\nThe circular economy is the most exciting idea in corporate sustainability, and it’s spreading fast: companies are finding ways to take back, refurbish, reuse or recycle products that would otherwise be thrown away, creating a closed-loop, zero-waste circular system of production to replace the old-fashioned take-make-waste linear model.\nAt Disney World, food waste is being converted into energy. Novelis is betting its future on recycled aluminum, although beverage companies have been slow to follow. Coffee waste is being turned into flour by an ex-Starbucks exec. “Don’t let fashion go to waste,” says H&M, the global clothing retailer that takes backs clothes in all of its 3,100 stores.\nIn a truly circular economy, powered by renewable energy, economic growth could be decoupled from environmental limits. It’s a safe bet that we won’t get there in 2015 or 2025 or even 2035. But we will surely get closer.\nThis piece is part of the supply chain hub, which is funded by the Fairtrade Foundation.

        "conteudo": "Traditionally, chemical suppliers focus on selling their products in the largest possible quantities. But critics argue that, while profitable, this business model encourages the overuse of chemicals and places a strain on human health and the environment.\nThe United Nations Industrial Development Organization has long promoted an alternative business model: “chemical leasing,” which it claims encourages better chemicals management. This week, the organization is holding its third global chemical leasing awards, an event designed to encourage adoption of the model.\nThe concept behind chemical leasing is relatively simple: instead of paying for the volume of chemicals that they consume, companies pay for the services rendered by the chemicals. For example, depending on the service, they may pay based on the volume of water treated, the number of parts painted or the lengths of pipes cleaned.\nUNIDO claims that, by decoupling payment from consumption, chemical leasing encourages better chemicals management. “This results in clear environmental advantages as well as consequent economic benefits for both suppliers and users of chemicals,” the organization claims.\nIn 2005, UNIDO launched its Global Chemical Leasing Programme, supported by the Austrian and German governments. Since then, it has initiated projects in a number of countries, including Serbia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Brazil, Croatia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Russia, Ukraine and Uganda. The initiatives cover a range of sectors, from agriculture and food processing to the health service and metal working industries. For the most part, they focus on cleaning, lubrication and wastewater treatment processes, but some are more specialised, such as paint stripping, oil drilling and newspaper printing processes.\nThrough these projects, the chemical leasing model is gaining recognition among multinational companies such as Coca-Cola, Ecolab, Carlsberg, Henkel, Ikea and General Motors. Many of these global companies are discovering that, given the right conditions, they can prosper by buying and selling chemicals as a service rather than a product.\nEnvironmental benefits?\nBut how, exactly, does this model benefit the environment? UNIDO says that, by pushing companies to focus on improving their operational efficiency, chemical leasing draws their attention to four main environmental problems: climate change, freshwater management, environmental pollution and waste-resource management.\nUNIDO claims that chemical leasing could also boost energy efficiency (and reduce greenhouse gas emissions) because service companies would be more motivated to reduce the cost per service – and therefore the use of energy and other resources – than companies that don’t count chemical use as their core business.\nSimilarly, in regions where freshwater resources are scarce, service companies would have more of an incentive to cut their processes’ water use. The chemical leasing model could also improve waste-resource management – first of all because there would theoretically be less waste, if service companies are focused on efficient chemical use; and secondly because it would be handled by experts focused exclusively on these chemicals.\nAccording to a UNIDO study, the global industrial cleaning industry is one particular area where chemical leasing could best achieve these benefits. Analyzing selected industrial cleaning sectors – such as metal parts cleaning, pipe and vessel cleaning, and water purification for industrial purposes – the study claims companies that consume more than 2.6m tonnes of chemicals per year could save up to 1.2m tonnes of solvents and cleaning agents.\nUNIDO’s study also suggests that companies of this size could potentially see a reduction of waste and emissions by more than 100,000 tonnes per year, as well as energy savings of at least 300,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents and health benefits due to reduced worker exposure. These economic benefits, it argues, could total over $160m annually.\nIndustry taking note\nGiven those potential savings, it’s not surprising that several companies have launched chemical leasing pilot projects. For the last five years, for example, beer manufacturer Carlsberg has scaled its chemical use based on the price of chemicals per hectolitre of beer produced. By using this model with its suppliers – which are responsible for providing chemicals for hygiene in brewing and packaging areas – the company has been able to use chemicals and resources more efficiently.\n“This model helps us to reduce our energy, steam, water and chemical usage in all areas possible, while still maintaining a high level of performance,” a Carlsberg spokesperson says.\nSimilarly, in 2012 Coca-Cola contracted Ecolab, a global provider of water, hygiene and energy technologies and services, to work on its sprawling Serbian operations. Ecolab’s job was to improve the use of chemicals in three processes: lubricating the bottling conveyors, cleaning equipment surfaces and washing bottles.\nPayment was based on the number of packed products that the operations shipped out, rather than the quantity of chemicals used. Coca-Cola declined to provide specific details, but UNIDO says the project was scheduled to start in January 2013 and that its economic savings are estimated at about $73,900 per year.\nEcolab has also been involved in another chemical leasing project, initiated by UNIDO, with Knjaz Miloš, Serbia’s largest producer of mineral water and beverages. Previously, the company’s conveyor belts were lubricated with a water-based chemical that caused eye and skin irritation and polluted the surrounding rivers and streams.\nEcolab modified the production process by installing automated dosing systems and spraying nozzles, and by replacing the water-based lubricant with a dry, non-hazardous one. According to UNIDO, the change reduced chemical consumption by 50% and conserved water, leading to a yearly cost savings of $7,021 per packaging line.\nEfficiency and the environment\nWhile chemical leasing contracts may be more efficient, though, they don’t always involve moving to safer chemical substitutes. Joel Tickner, director of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell’s Department of Community Health and Sustainability, says that although a company may be reducing the volume of dangerous chemicals being used through a leasing service, it’s not always “detoxifying”.\n“It’s a nice idea in principle, but if you’re not removing hazardous substances then there isn’t necessarily a great incentive for green chemistry, and this may stifle the move to safer alternatives,” Tickner says.\nTickner’s view is mirrored in “Critical reflections on the chemical leasing concept,” an academic study by sustainability researchers Rodrigo Lozano, Angela Carpenter and Francisco J Lozano. According to the study’s authors, while chemical leasing has the potential to improve process efficiency, it does not respond to the long-term environmental issues that green chemistry hopes to address.\nWhereas chemical leasing focuses on better management and control of the use of chemicals in an industrial process, they write, green chemistry works to create chemicals that are more environmentally friendly.\nThat said, many academics and industry representatives – including the study’s authors – believe that chemical leasing shows great potential to help the chemical industry become greener in the short-term.\n“There is already empirical evidence of the economic and environmental benefits to be gained by both the suppliers and the users of chemicals, through collaborative activities,” the report concludes.\nThe values-led business hub is funded by SC Johnson.

        "conteudo": "Guardian sustainable business\nDavos 2014: climate change and sustainability – day three as it happened\nAll of the sustainable business action from Friday at the World Economic Forum. Look out for our coverage on:\nYoung people and climate change\nBusiness model innovation & design\nCities and climate change\nUpdated\nA participant makes his way to a session during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos January 24, 2014. Photograph: Ruben Sprich / Reuters\nJo Confino and Caroline Holtum in Davos, Laura Paddison in London and Jennifer Kho in New York\nFriday 24 January 2014 18.31 EST\nLast modified on Tuesday 3 June 2014 00.30 EDT\n18:26\nMindy Lubber: finding hope at Davos from Twitter\nMindy Lubber, president of US NGO Ceres, takes a break from the meetings at Davos to get some perspective from social media. She writes:\nForsaking the freezing cold and the nonstop meetings here in Davos, I'm scrolling through my Twitter feed. Some of the tweets are scary (“California’s drought from space”) and others are downright frustrating (“Europe relaxes renewables target”), but most of the headlines I’ve seen during this essential global climate meeting give me hope: \"India nearly doubled its solar power capacity in 2013\", \"China boosts 2014 solar target\", \"Texas first state to reach 10,000 megawatts of wind capacity\".\nIn spite of climate policy gridlock, the conversation about climate change in the business community has progressed exponentially in the past couple of years. The business world is acting with more urgency. Just last week at the UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk in New York City, dozens of investment banks, insurance companies and institutional investors announced significant financial investments in clean-energy projects that will benefit their bottom lines and help limit climate change.\nIt’s no surprise that businesses are responding. Climate change is wreaking havoc on company supply chains, and cost-competitive renewable technologies are available to replace the biggest climate change culprit: fossil fuels.\nSolutions for tackling climate change are at our fingertips. Companies and investors must invest more in clean energy , and policymakers need to level the playing field, setting a price for carbon pollution and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies.\nAt least one thing is clear today from Davos: the rest of the world has moved on and isn’t waiting for climate policy to catch up.\nUpdated\n14:59\nDara O'Rourke: why is sustainability so hard?\nDara O’Rourke, a professor at UC Berkeley and the co-founder of GoodGuide.com , is the chair of WEF's Global Agenda Council on Sustainable Consumption. He writes:\n﻿One thing that has surprised me in my time in Davos is how often I’ve heard CEOs complain about how hard it is to promote sustainability and social responsibility inside their companies.\nIn session after session, it has been clear that even the most powerful CEOs feel that transforming their organizations is hard.\nVery hard.\nIn one of the few “public” sessions where CEOs talked about this, the panelists presented a long list of impediments to changing business for the good, including: a few bad apple companies (which have sunk public trust in corporations to record lows); investors (which think too short-term); the media (which only runs negative stories and beats up on them even when they try CSR); corporate boards (that are too share price focused); government regulation (which causes more problems than it solves); and consumers (who think green products perform worse and won't pay more).\nMy first thought is that these sound like a bunch of scapegoats. (Interestingly, I haven't heard the same litany in sessions about technological disruptions and supply chain innovations.) Further, what about the role of the CEOs themselves? And of the ways that some corporations undermine the institutions needed to address global sustainability issues?\nBut my second thought is that these are believable stoppers to sustainability. Short-term investors? Check. Conflicted boards? Probably. Selfish consumers? Sure. Although no single one of these is the root cause of sustainability failures, together they create enough barriers to block most sustainability initiatives inside corporations.\nThat brings me to my third thought, if each of these barriers can block sustainability initiatives, then how do we align systems and incentives to move sustainability forward? And can strong leaders push past these blockages? For instance, it was fantastic to hear that Richard Goyders, the CEO of Wesfarmers, no longer meets with short-term investors. And to hear Marks & Spencer and Unilever talk about engaging consumers in new ways.\nBut clearly, unique CEOs and individual corporate actions are not enough. We need partnerships - including NGO and government action - to address these blockages, and to create incentives for firms to push through them. We need ways to align supply chains to solve problems, instead of allowing any one barrier to block everything.\nAs one CEO quipped: Average CEOs do what average investors demand.\nIt’s time for exceptional leaders to create partnerships to push past these limits.\nUpdated\nHas complacency returned to the World Economic Forum?\nJo Confino adds a dash of pessimism to proceedings as he reflects on Davos so far:\nHas over-optimism infected Davos? The reason I ask this is because the pessimism over the economic crisis that infected the World Economic Forum in recent years, seems to have dissipated.\nBut, this desire to put the crisis behind us may be a chimera. Some at Davos still worry that there are great systemic risks and that the recovery remains fragile.\nThis over-confidence comes despite the fact that youth unemployment hangs over Davos like a black cloud, with all the social risks that this entails.\nThe issue is being discussed here, but there is a paucity of ideas, with experts still relying on what has tended to fail in the past, namely skills development and training.\nWhile the economy is picking up a little steam, it is unlikely to create the jobs that are needed to bring youth unemployment down significantly.\nSo all the more reason why governments need to back the 'green' economy, which is most likely to generate growth and employment. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen any time soon, given that many governments are choosing to abandoning the modest environmental commitments they had already made.\n12:53\nHow far have we come on tackling deforestation?\nJo Confino spoke with Kumi Naidoo, the international director of Greenpeace International who told him that we are on the verge of possible game changing interventions [on deforestation], but wouldn't say we've got there already.\nAsked where the real action is taking place, he said that some governments and some businesses are driving the change. He specifically noted the 'significant shift' by the Indonesian government and increased interest from developed country governments like Norway.\nOn the business side, he said those who use forest products like Nestle and Unilever have been moved by citizens, who have said they don't want to consume products that destroy forests. On the producer side, movement has been achieved by pressure. Asia Pulp & Paper, who used to be really aggressive in their opposition to Greenpeace, have now invited Greenpeace to help them make the transition to sustainability.\nKumi Naidoo international executive director of Greenpeace. Photograph: Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images\nUpdated\n11:59\nConnie Hedegaard: \"big business coalitions stopping progress\"\nWe managed to grab a couple of minutes with Connie Hedegaard, she was the Danish minister for climate and energy during Copenhagen and is now the European commissioner for climate action. She takes a stand against the large European business lobbying organisations, saying that they are holding progress on sustainability back. She also reminds us that it is not unusual that business thinks short-term; that is why you need politicians who dare to think long-term and take short-term decisions that don't work counter to where we should be going in the long-term.\nUpdated\n11:13\nEnding deforestation in supply chains\nAndrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute makes a pre-launch announcement about Global Forest Watch, an innovative new tool for tracking where deforestation is actually taking place. Accurate, timely information isn't accessible at the moment; by the time deforestation is detected 'cattle are already grazing amongst the stumps'.\nHere's what he had to say about the new tool:\nEverywhere I go I hear the same refrain from business leaders: we want to do our part to protect forests, but we need better information about what’s happening at the end of our supply chains. This is true in Indonesia, Brazil and the Ivory Coast.\nBut, things are starting to change. A quiet revolution is underway where lower cost technologies and global communications are giving businesses, governments, and forest managers much faster and more complete information.\nWRI and our partners are leveraging these changes. Next month, we are launching Global Forest Watch, a major new initiative that uses satellite technology, open data, and human networks to show where and how forests are changing. You will be able to view forests at a 30 meter resolution worldwide. This information can be shared by everyone with a computer and in formats they can easily act upon.\nWe’ll be previewing the platform in Davos, where businesses are making ambitious commitments to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. Let’s hope that more business and governments will join this effort.\nAchieving zero-net deforestation in beef, paper, soy and palm oil supply chains has the potential to half global deforestation rates.

If you don't want to end up on the wrong side of history, then it is time to put this at the top of your public affairs agenda, he says. A small hint of optimism creeps in as he also says that climate is back on the agenda in a way that it hasn't been since before Copenhagen.\nIkea CSO, calls for progressive companies to speak out or end up on the wrong side of history. Photograph: Remy de la Mauviniere/AP\nUpdated\n10:21\nNo deforestation and no exploitation - comment on the world's largest palm oil company's commitments\nScott Poynton, founder and executive director of TFT, a global NGO that works with companies to develop responsible products had this to say about corporate commitments on deforestation in advance of this afternoon's session on ending deforestation in supply chains:\nIn the past three years, many companies have made bold policy commitments to rid their supply chains of deforestation. Getting to the point of making the commitments has been challenging enough but the real work comes in implementation.\nWilmar, the world’s largest palm oil company, made a significant announcement last December, committing to no deforestation, no exploitation of people and no peatland development across its entire business – yes, including all the third party oil it trades. This is hugely significant, not only for the palm oil industry but for all agri-commodities. If Wilmar can do this for palm, why can’t others do it for soy, cocoa, sugar, beef, etc?\nWilmar’s announcement marks a breakthrough and strong implementation is now underway but the true breakthrough will come when others follow suit. Deforestation is happening because we suck it through our supply chains. At Davos, let’s hope those meeting in the ending deforestation session agree to make their own bold commitments and then set about implementing them to seriously reduce the scourge of deforestation.\n10:05\nDanish environment minister: Now is the time to campaign for a sustainable development goal on water\nI have been speaking with Danish environment minister Ida Auken who says there needs to be a concerted effort to ensure that water becomes a post-2015 development goal in its own right, rather than being split between various targets.\nHere is what she had to say:\n﻿Water is the foundation for life. Did we forget that?\nIt seems as if a lot of leaders still take water for granted. But the the fact is that in just 16 years from now, half of the world’s population will be living in areas with water stress. This is an unacceptable outlook.\nThe World Economic Forum has acknowledged this threat and identified it as the number three global risk we face. But what to do about it? We discussed this in a session here in Davos and agreed that we need a global sustainable development goal (SDG) dedicated to water. The goal should include targets on all three aspects of water – social (access to water and sanitation), environmental (water quality) and economic (water efficiency).\nA global goal on water can help steer development and investments and it can guide leaders in all fields, not least political leaders. But a global goal on water will not be easy to get. So we all need to start lobbying now.\nIf you have an opportunity to influence any UN-ambassador in New York, do it. If you can impact your national government to support such a goal, do it. And if you get a platform to speak up, tell people that if we are to set ourselves goals for a sustainable future, we must have a goal dedicated to water.\nIda Auken, Denmark's environment minister.

By working on very practical initiatives and getting something moving on a stable price of carbon, we can create a platform that makes it easier for politicians to reach an agreement.\nWe can all act now. There are so many win win win situations.”\nWhile Kim appealed to peoples’ business sense, he also gave a very personal appeal for action. Pointing out that his youngest son may still be alive in the year 2100, he said: “Oh my god, we try to give people a sense of urgency by 2030 but even that is not working yet. All our children and future generations will ask of their ancestors; what did you do when you knew about the impact of climate change.”\n09:01\nGreenpeace's Kumi Naidoo and Oxfam's Winnie Byanyima: corporate power and climate change\nOn climate day at Davos, Greenpeace's Kumi Naidoo and Oxfam's Winnie Byanyima call for a concerted effort from progressive companies to push governments to set tougher climate change targets. They highlight big food and beverage companies as among those that have the most to be gained from standing up and being counted on climate change:\n﻿Their bottom line is under threat as extreme weather and shifting seasons threaten to disrupt their supply chains and drive higher and more volatile commodity prices.\nThey should be doing much more to tackle their own emissions, including switching to 100% renewable energy in their operations and by taking the lead in ditching suppliers who recklessly cause deforestation. They should use their substantial power and influence to demand action from governments and not allow big polluters to dominate business groups such as the International Chamber of Commerce. With exceptions, their modest role in national and global debates on climate action to date has been striking given how much they have to lose.\n07:49\nNike's Hannah Jones - we need to collaborate to tackle systemic challenges\nHannah Jones, vice-president of sustainable business and innovation at Nike, is at Davos and has been writing about the immense complexity of mainstreaming the principles of the circular economy into the company’s core operations.\n﻿While Nike-led technologies have greatly advanced the integration of sustainability and performance, materials innovation is not a problem we can solve alone.\nCreating a sustainable palette of materials would be disruptive to the world of production, but it’s also incredibly complicated. The production of Nike footwear and apparel is contracted to around 765 factories globally. Materials for those products are supplied by hundreds more vendors. And those products use a palette of more than 16,000 materials.\nAnd that’s just Nike’s supply chain. It is clear that no single company, organisation or government has the ability to tackle this innovation challenge on their own. Instead, it will require new models of collaboration.\nWe need to catalyse capital, capabilities, science and technology and resources far beyond the boundaries of our own supply chain. To tackle massive systemic challenges like those in the materials and manufacturing industries, Nike is harnessing the collective power of unconventional collaborations. Our ability to positively influence the systems in which we operate is critical to our future success.\n07:03\nPaul Simpson - regulators must make action on stranded assets mandatory\nI've been speaking to Paul Simpson, the CEO of global NGO CDP, who has just come out of a debate on the risk of stranded carbon assets to capital markets.\nThis is what he had to say:\n﻿The IPCC, which has shown we have already emitted more than half of the one trillion tonnes of our total carbon budget, has alerted the world to the limits of emissions.\nThis means that a significant percentage of fossil fuel reserves needs to be kept in the ground to keep us within a maximum two degree warming. The discussion concluded that stranded carbon assets present a potential material risk to the global economy and compared this to the risk of inflated real estate assets that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe meeting focused on the need for better disclosure from fossil fuel companies on the potential of their reserves to be stranded and their plans of how they intend to respond to this.\nGiven that current accounting rules do not require them to do this , the discussion concluded that institutional investors and financial market regulators must take action to make this mandatory.\nInterestingly, the governor of the central bank of Korea, Kim Choong-Soo, who was present, said he could not initially understand why he had been invited, but after hearing the speakers, said he now recognised it as a significant issue for his country.\nUpdated\n06:40\nMichael Porter v Paul Polman – who is more radical?\nI caught up with Michael Porter and asked him about Unilever CEO Paul Polman’s recent comment to me that Porter's \"shared value\" concept is no longer radical enough.\nThis is what he had to say:\n﻿We think shared value is tremendously radical. It redefines how business operates at the core – how they think about their products and value chains, how they think about the boundaries of their responsibilities.\nA lot of companies are still on the journey between CSR and shared value and have not made the truly radical transformation of seeing society and social issues as being a core part of running the business.\nPaul uses the label of sustainability for much of their work. We believe that sustainability is not necessarily shared valued; it is a broad catch-all phrase. We have been accustomed for too long to believing there is a trade off between profitability and doing good which has fostered a culture that makes it profitable to pollute and make factories an unsafe place to work.\nBut this idea is Alice in Wonderland; actually societal problems are the greatest business opportunity to restructure how you operate, to become more productive. Selling products to Africa is not doing good but a giant new market.\nBut this takes a long time – CEOs often see the opportunity but it’s difficult driving it down into the organisation, where staff are used to thinking narrowly.\nPorter gave the example of Dow Chemical which had created new billion dollar businesses after deciding to look at how the company could contribute to the Millennium Development Goals.\nThe agony and the ecstasy of the circular economy\nThe circular economy is a great concept but heck, it is difficult to bring into reality.\nThese are the conclusions of a World Economic Forum (WEF) report launched today in Davos.\nThe study points to mouth watering savings of $1 trillion a year by 2025 and the creation of 100 000 new jobs within five years.\nBut like may other radical new business models it requires a systemic change, which no single business or organisation can bring about on their own.\nThat’s because the circular economy relies on the eradication of toxins from products so they can be up-cycled.\nBut even the most simple products can contain hundreds of different substances, which each need to be tested.\nNot only is that an uphill task of its own, but many suppliers plead confidentiality and refuse to even tell their customers what materials they use.\nThis is why WEF, in collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation is launching Project Mainstream; a collaboration of businesses that will focus their attention on a few key products that will have a global impact.\nRead Jo Confino’s full report here .\nA new report on the the circular economy - offers significant opportunities that could be very challenging to realise.

London Mayor Boris Johnson is always a tease and thought it was a great idea for the Guardian to publish this photo of him being “bought” by Coke.\nHere he is with his own personalised Coke can, along with Muhtar Kent, the CEO of the drinks giant.\nJohnson joked that while he should not announce it, Coke was going to become the next corporate to sponsor his Boris bikes scheme in the capital.\nThis, of course, may not be a bad idea given that Coke is focussing on wellbeing and encouraging people to exercise.\nWas Johnson being more serious than he was letting on? Only time will tell.\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson with Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent. Photograph: Guardian\nUpdated\n03:21\nPositive noises on finance for the green economy\nRachel Kyte, group vice president and special envoy for climate change at the World Bank, echoes Achim Steiner's reflection on the positive outcome of yesterday's session on finance and the green economy.\nShe sent us this update:\nFollowing on from the Investor Summit on Climate Change in New York earlier this month there has been lots of discussion about the future of green bonds. Zurich Re, some weeks ago, indicated that it would buy $1bn in green bonds. Discussions in this session sought to encourage others to follow suit. Can infrastructure, energy and other companies follow EDF and issue corporate green bonds, was the other question up for discussion. And Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank asked why not aim to double the size of the green bond market to $20bn by time of the UN Leaders Summit in September and double it again (or more) to $50bn by the Paris climate summit in December 2015. Doable seemed the response. An impactful result if the growth expands the universe of investors going into green assets.\nUpdated\nKey event\nAchim Steiner, the executive director of UNEP gives us a whistle stop tour of his day yesterday:\nDavos! Big debates, big brains, big names. My day consisted of 16 hours of non-stop meetings with people full of ideas, sometimes full of themselves but all important in some way.\nThe water session this morning : it must be progress when CEOs, ministers of finance and presidents focus on the global water crisis even if the answers only semi-reassuring.\nNext session: getting sustainability into the DNA of business. I listened to some real pioneers in the business world. I see some real shifts here, but why still so few leaders? The debate centred on what to do about the average CEO.\nThen agriculture and climate change, two big topics in Davos this year.

        "conteudo": "For his first major energy policy remarks, Donald Trump would quote, almost verbatim at times, from an op-ed published in the Grand Forks Herald earlier that morning. But Trump was not the author.\nThe byline belonged to local congressman Kevin Cramer, the longtime champion of his state’s oil and gas industries. North Dakota has boomed and busted right along with the price of gas. Trump would start his speech by telling the state’s oil executives that they were standing at the “forefront of a new energy revolution” powered by Trumpian deregulation and protectionism.\nAs if it had been dredged from the Bakken Formation still dripping with crude, this was a speech both from and of North Dakota.\nBefore the newly confirmed Republican nominee took to the stage in Bismarck, Cramer, a self-professed climate sceptic, had been invited up in front of the press and praised by Trump as a “talented person” bound for a role in his administration.\n“You’ve changed my life,” Cramer said. “I appreciate your comments on energy, and I’m looking forward to hearing the rest of it.” But of course, Cramer had heard it all before.\n‘President Obama has done everything he can to kill the coal industry’\nThis might have had some of the shale gas supremos shifting uncomfortably in their seats. Yes, the coal industry has sustained massive losses. For this, Trump blamed “stupid” regulations brought in by Obama: “Regulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants”. But the real coal killer has been shale gas.\nThe Carbon Tracker thinktank found last year the coal industry had entered into a “structural decline” and primarily blamed the massive decline in the price of shale gas along with increasingly competitive renewable energy.\n“Lots of studies show that environmental rules are far less important than other economic factors like wages, global commodity prices, and cost of materials,” said professor Patrick Parenteau from the Vermont Law School. “The coal industry has killed more mining jobs, not to mention miners, through mechanization than environmental regs. Natural gas has closed more coal plants than Obama. And so on.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nProjections for electricity generation to 2040 with and without the clean power plan. Photograph: EIA\nTrump took particular aim at Obama’s clean power plan, currently stalled in the supreme court. Recently released Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections for coal power show that the clean power plan is not the death knell for coal, as Trump says. The most carbon-intensive fuel made up 33% of electricity generation in 2015. With Obama’s clean power plan, that will slowly decline to 18% by 2040. If Trump has his way and the plan is scrapped, coal will continue to taper off to 26%.\nRhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said: “The solar industry alone employs more than four times as many people as the coal industry. ... Let’s talk about the jobs of tomorrow. That is what this election is about.”\n“You got to get rid of some of the regulations,” Trump said. “[Coal mines] have people that do nothing but deal with regulators. It’s gotten out of control.”\nParenteau disagrees: “Overall, the data shows that on balance environmental regulations produce substantial net economic benefits for the nation.”\nAn EPA spokeswoman said the past year had seen exceptional milestones reached in the transition toward clean energy.\n“These market signals speak for themselves. The CPP isn’t driving these shifts; it was designed to underpin them. Even without the CPP in place yet, they’re happening anyway,” she said.\nFederal surveying showed green states consistently outperforming brown states against a number of economic indicators, including good-paying jobs.\n“The study is no longer being done in part because the conclusions never changed,” Parenteau said.\n‘Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence’\n“Most in the day-to-day of the energy industry will tell you that the concept of true “energy independence” (ie not importing any energy) isn’t really practical,” said Ethan Zindler, the US chief of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The global nature of the energy market and the US’s significant levels of incoming and outgoing oil, gas and electricity make independence virtually impossible.\nTrump also promised today to approve the Keystone XL pipeline – something he would be able to do if TransCanada enters a new application. Energy independence might be difficult once all that cheap tar sands oil starts flowing into Texas from Alberta.\n“The more practical goal is energy security, and that does contain an element of\nbeing less reliant on imports, for sure,” Zindler said.\n‘President Obama’s anti-energy orders have also weakened our security by keeping us reliant on foreign sources of energy’\nZindler points out that US oil imports have declined in the past seven years. “Whether that’s Obama’s doing or not is another story, but it’s not like we’ve become more reliant.”\nTrump also said he planned to use his oil-buying clout in the Gulf to further US foreign policy goals, namely defeating Isis. This would be unachievable with total US energy independence.\n‘We’re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement’\nThis, as has been demonstrated in dozens of articles since Trump openly threatened the Paris agreement last week, is simply fantasy. Hundreds of countries created the Paris agreement, and it is not within the power of any single nation to “cancel” it. Further, if it is ratified this year, as expected, the US and all other nations will be locked into the agreement for four years.\nBut the potential for a Trump White House to derail the climate process is another matter. The Paris agreement remains unfinished and imperfect, relying on all countries to increase their emissions cuts in the coming years. It also places the emphasis on national governments to chart their own course, expecting them to bow to international peer pressure – pangs of conscience to which Trump appears immune.\nSuh said that while Trump may have little power over the US’s formal relationship to the Paris deal, he might do enough damage simply through inaction at home.\n“He could delay a range of steps needed to meet the Paris commitments, including not imposing limits on methane leakage, not moving ahead with clean car standards, and not moving ahead with energy efficiency standards. Some of those things will be challenged in court. But even if they were in some legal limbo, he would effectively halt our progress ... in what we all know is an incredibly urgent decade to make progress,” she said.\n‘Wind [power] is killing all of the eagles’\nIt’s true, 83,000 hawks, falcons and eagles are killed by US wind farms each year. But if Trump were truly worried about eagles, said a spokesman for the Audubon Society, he’d probably at least have mentioned global warming in his speech (he didn’t).\n“The number one threat to birds and people is climate change, which as you know is a result of our burning fossil fuels,” said the spokesman. Adding that coal, oil and gas production are directly responsible for more deaths than wind or solar.\nNot that wind farms are innocent. “We do encourage responsibly-sited wind farms in order to reduce the threats wind power poses to eagles and other birds,” the spokesman said.\n‘I know a lot about solar’\nTrump added that the problem with solar was that it was too expensive and that home systems took 30 years to pay themselves back.\n“We see systems paying for themselves in less than a third of that time in a number of parts of the world,” Zindler said. “Perhaps he’s talking about a system installed in a very un-sunny part of the world located to adjacent to a coal plant producing super-cheap energy. Or perhaps he’s simply using data on the costs of solar that are badly outdated. Quite possible, given that we’ve seen equipment prices for solar drop 80% or more in the past several years.”",

        "conteudo": "The Obama administration has never fined or prosecuted a windfarm for killing eagles and other protected bird species, shielding the industry from liability and helping keep the scope of the deaths secret, an Associated Press investigation has found.\nMore than 573,000 birds are killed by the country's windfarms each year, including 83,000 hunting birds such as hawks, falcons and eagles, according to an estimate published in March in the peer-reviewed Wildlife Society Bulletin.\nEach death is federal crime, a charge that the Obama administration has used to prosecute oil companies when birds drown in their waste pits, and power companies when birds are electrocuted by their power lines. No wind energy company has been prosecuted, even those that repeatedly flout the law.\nWind power, a pollution-free energy intended to ease global warming, is a cornerstone of President Barack Obama's energy plan. His administration has championed a $1bn-a-year tax break to the industry that has nearly doubled the amount of wind power in his first term.\n\"It is the rationale that we have to get off of carbon, we have to get off of fossil fuels, that allows them to justify this,\" said Tom Dougherty, a long-time environmentalist who worked for nearly 20 years for the National Wildlife Federation in the West, until his retirement in 2008. \"But at what cost? In this case, the cost is too high.\"\nDocuments and emails obtained by The Associated Press offer glimpses of the problem: 14 deaths at seven facilities in California, five each in New Mexico and Oregon, one in Washington state and another in Nevada, where an eagle was found with a hole in its neck, exposing the bone.\nOne of the deadliest places in the country for golden eagles is Wyoming, where federal officials said windfarms had killed more than four dozen golden eagles since 2009, predominantly in the southeastern part of the state. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to disclose the figures. Getting precise figures is impossible because many companies aren't required to disclose how many birds they kill. And when they do, experts say, the data can be unreliable.\nWhen companies voluntarily report deaths, the Obama administration in many cases refuses to make the information public, saying it belongs to the energy companies or that revealing it would expose trade secrets or implicate ongoing enforcement investigations.\nNearly all the birds being killed are protected under federal environmental laws, which prosecutors have used to generate tens of millions of dollars in fines and settlements from businesses, including oil and gas companies, over the past five years.\n\"What it boils down to is this: If you electrocute an eagle, that is bad, but if you chop it to pieces, that is OK,\" said Tim Eicher, a former US Fish and Wildlife Service enforcement agent.\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service says it is investigating 18 bird-death cases involving wind-power facilities and seven have been referred to the Justice Department. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to discuss the status of those cases.\nIn its defence, the wind-energy industry points out that more eagles are killed each year by cars, electrocutions and poisoning than by turbines. Dan Ashe, the Fish and Wildlife Service's director, said that his agency always has made clear to wind companies that if they kill birds they would still be liable.\n\"We are not allowing them to do it. They do it,\" he said of the bird deaths. \"And we will successfully prosecute wind companies if they are in significant noncompliance.\"\nWindfarms are clusters of turbines as tall as 30-story buildings, with spinning rotors the size of jetliners.\nFlying eagles behave like drivers texting on their cell phones – they don't look up. As they scan for food, they don't notice the industrial turbine blades until it's too late.\nFormer interior secretary Ken Salazar, in an interview with the AP before his departure, denied any preferential treatment for wind. Interior Department officials said that criminal prosecution, regardless of the industry, is always a \"last resort\".\n\"There's still additional work to be done with eagles and other avian species, but we are working on it very hard,\" Salazar said. \"We will get to the right balance.\"\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration has proposed a rule that would give wind-energy companies potentially decades of shelter from prosecution for killing eagles. The regulation is currently under review at the White House.\nThe proposal, made at the urging of the wind-energy industry, would allow companies to apply for 30-year permits to kill a set number of bald or golden eagles. Previously, companies were only eligible for five-year permits.\n\"It's basically guaranteeing a black box for 30 years, and they're saying 'trust us for oversight'. This is not the path forward,\" said Katie Umekubo, a renewable energy attorney with the Natural Resources Defence Council, who argued in private meetings with the industry and government leaders that the 30-year permit needed an in-depth environmental review.\nBut the eagle rule is not the first time the administration has made concessions for the wind-energy industry.\nLast year, over objections from some of its own wildlife investigators and biologists, the Interior Department updated its guidelines and provided more cover for wind companies that violate the law.\nUnder both the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the death of a single bird without a permit is illegal.\nBut under the Obama administration's new guidelines, wind-energy companies don't face additional scrutiny until they have a \"significant adverse impact\" on wildlife or habitat.\nThat rare exception for one industry substantially weakened the government's ability to enforce the law and ignited controversy inside the Interior Department.\n\"US Fish and Wildlife Service does not do this for the electric utility industry or other industries,\" Kevin Kritz, a government wildlife biologist in the Rocky Mountain region wrote in internal agency comments in September 2011. \"Other industries will want to be judged on a similar standard.\"\nThe Obama administration, however, repeatedly overruled its own experts. In the end, the wind energy industry, which was part of the committee that drafted and edited the guidelines, got almost everything it wanted.\n\"Clearly, there was a bias to wind energy in their favor because they are a renewable source of energy, and justifiably so,\" said Rob Manes, who runs the Kansas office for The Nature Conservancy and who served on the committee. \"We need renewable energy in this country.\"",

Since opening in 2013, the business has saved its customers £2m and reduced carbon emissions from the hospitality sector by 34,000 tonnes.\nCo-founder Marc Zornes, who researched food waste while working at business consultants McKinsey, says research into energy efficiency in buildings and cars attracts lots of money but there’s “hardly any investment into dealing with the issue of food waste”.\nThe Winnow system has a simple touch screen connected to waste bins that weigh each item. Staff log everything they throw away – where it comes from (eg peelings or leftovers), the food type (eg vegetable), and the specific product (eg onion).\nRelated: Doggy bags to pig feed: 10 things we learned about food waste\nThus kitchens can track where most waste is produced and make changes to reduce this. A restaurant might reduce portions of frequently leftover dishes, or a staff canteen might make smaller batches of often unfinished meals.\nFor the first 12 months, Winnow was self-funded, with its co-founders (Zornes and Kevin Duffy) sacrificing their salaries from their day jobs. In that time, Winnow proved its tech could facilitate substantial savings.\nRecently collected anonymised data shows that waste can easily occur in food production and that Winnow users can record a 25% reduction in waste in the first month of use.\nThe business’s profile has grown in the past 12 months and a seed funding round closed with £600,000 last May. Swiftly following this was a series A round, which closed in January and, in all, will have raised £2.5m.\nWinnow is the 2016 winner of the startup of the year category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards.",

The Guardian wanted to give you the latest weather report from inside ExxonMobil’s annual general meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, but the newspaper’s reporter was banned.\nRelated: Hypersensitive Exxon bans Guardian from AGM\nBattening down the hatches and whistling as the winds of climate change threaten its business has been the oil giant’s strategy for decades. The problem for ExxonMobil is, the winds are approaching gale force and the people who own the company - its shareholders - are increasingly worried about the damage.\nExxonMobil investors worth $10 trillion backed a motion at the AGM asking the company to tell them what would happen to its bottom line if governments meet their pledge to slash carbon emissions and halt global warming. The company tried to stop shareholders even voting on the motion, until the US Securities and Exchange Commission blew that objection away.\nGetting answers out of the ExxonMobil bunker is not easy. Even the largest shareholders are barred from speaking to its directors, a situation described as “extraordinary” by Anne Simpson, head of corporate governance at Calpers, the $290bn pension fund for California’s state employees. “Exxon is an outlier: a minority of one,” she says.\nSince March 2015 ExxonMobil has issued a stock response to the Guardian’s enquiries, saying it refuses to comment “because of the Guardian’s lack of objectivity on climate-change reporting, demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers”.\nThat’s a serious charge, so let’s take it in steps. The first serious question is whether ExxonMobil is in a position to judge what objectivity – “not being influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts” – actually is.\nThe company knew of climate change as early as 1977 but spent the next 30 years and at least £30m promoting climate-change denial and blocking action. While telling shareholders there was too much uncertainty about global warming to take action, it was building exploration facilities that allowed for the sea level rise it knew was on the way. As a result the company is under investigation by attorney generals from 17 US states.\nPerhaps more objective is the unanimous agreement by the world’s governments that there is “the need for an effective and progressive response to the urgent threat of climate change”. Or the conclusion of the biggest scientific endeavour in history, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded global warming is set to inflict “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts”.\nRelated: My father warned Exxon about climate change in the 1970s. They didn't listen | Claudia Black-Kalinsky\nBut ExxonMobil’s specific charge is that the Keep it in the Ground campaign damaged the Guardian’s objectivity. The campaign was narrowly focused, in asking the world’s two biggest health charities to sell off their fossil fuel investments on the basis that burning all oil, gas and coal would cause catastrophic climate change. The fact that investors controlling $3.4 trillion (including the Guardian) have committed to divest from fossil fuels suggests many found these arguments compelling.\nCampaigns are commonplace in UK newspapers and readers understand the line between these and regular reporting. Transparency is the key and the targets of the Guardian campaign were given space to make their counter-arguments and the whole process was made public in a behind-the-scenes podcast series.\nThe climate-change motion prompted a record shareholder rebellion of 38% at ExxonMobil’s AGM this week, but was defeated. So investors have been denied transparency on the impacts of climate change on the company. These investors include huge pension funds from New York, California and the Netherlands, the Church of England, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund - built from Norway’s oil riches - and banks and insurers such as HSBC and Axa. Will ExxonMobil dismiss these as “anti-oil and gas activists” too?\nExxonMobil’s final barb – that it is a company “that provides energy necessary for modern life” – is facile. When a storm is coming, you change your clothes. If we had always lived tomorrow as we lived yesterday, we’d still be wearing bear skins. People have little choice but to use fossil fuels today, but clean energy is fast blowing them away.\nA whirlwind of new technology left the camera films that Kodak had been making for over a century redundant and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012.\nCalpers holds $1bn of ExxonMobil shares and Simpson says the company is facing a similar tempest: “This is their Kodak moment. If they want to still be in business in 30 years, they have to understand the changes that are taking place.”\nShell, BP, Total and Statoil are among the big oil companies that have climbed out of the storm bunker and started listening to their shareholders’ climate-change fears. ExxonMobil remains hunkered below, shouting “conspiracy” and refusing to let in the 21st century, let alone Guardian reporters.",

We have seen British Gas mercilessly hound hard-up customers even when bills are in dispute,” said Fuel Poverty Action’s Ruth London.\nBritish Gas, which holds around 40% of UK gas accounts, has announced three price cuts in the last 12 months which it claims could lower a dual fuel bill by almost £100 a year.\nHowever, critics have always argued that the cuts have been small compared with the savings made from tumbling wholesale costs, partly caused by the collapse in the global price of oil and gas.\nFuel Poverty Action blamed the government for failing to crack down on energy suppliers. “Despite all the headlines, the power of the big six remains absolute, thanks to a government that is happy to leave its citizens to die in cold homes.\n“Cuts to insulation programmes and renewable energy have made customers colder while lining the pockets of big six shareholders,” said London.\nThe strong performance at British Gas came as parent company Centrica made almost £2bn of writedowns due to the plunging price of oil and gas.\nThe figures show total British Gas operating profits at £809m, down 2% while Centrica group’s adjusted operating profits fell 12% to £1.5bn, roughly in line with analyst forecasts.\nHowever, those profits did not take into account £1.8bn worth of writedowns, almost double the scale of last year, as the continuing fall in global energy prices hit the group’s “upstream” exploration and production assets in the North Sea and elsewhere.\nCentrica said last summer it would be exiting some of the production businesses and has announced plans to cut 6,000 posts across the group or 10% of its workforce. It has simultaneously promised to create 2,000 new jobs.\nIan Conn, the Centrica chief executive, said the group was performing well in difficult circumstances and there would be no cut in the dividend to shareholders.\n“Centrica has delivered a resilient financial performance, with solid 2015 adjusted earnings despite the challenge of falling wholesale oil and gas prices. Operating cash flow has been strong, and with capital discipline this has allowed the group to reduce net debt. In 2016 we expect operating cash flow also to be over £2bn.”",

This view has been vindicated this week.\nThe commission has stated it is unconvinced about the chances for any uranium industry expansion and acknowledges nuclear power as not commercially viable in the foreseeable future.\nHowever, like the product involved, the commission was glowing about the opportunities that could come from hosting international high level radioactive waste.\nAround the world radioactive waste management is a growing and unresolved management issue and environmental challenge. If managing nuclear waste was so straightforward or lucrative then it would have already been done.\nSome countries, most notably Finland, are advancing deep geological burial sites but the cost and complexity is high. After seven decades of commercial nuclear power operations not one nation has a final disposal site for high level waste and the sector is strewn with failed projects, timeline delays and massive cost overruns.\nAgainst this landscape it is hard to see Australia providing the silver bullet, or even some buckshot.\nWe have limited nuclear industry experience and infrastructure and lack the regulatory framework to manage such waste. Moreover, a range of state and federal laws expressly preclude such an activity, one which has no bi-partisan political support in a deeply sceptical and contested Australian public sphere.\nAustralia’s dismal track record in relation to managing our own modest stockpile of radioactive waste is also hardly cause for confidence in the commission’s global ambition.\nFor over two decades successive federal governments have tried, and failed, to convince and coerce remote Aboriginal communities in South Australia and the Northern Territory to accept a waste site.\nA revised national siting approach is currently facing strong community opposition in the six regions under active consideration. Three of these new sites are in South Australia and the commission’s enthusiasm to open the door for an international waste site may well see local communities ever more determined oppose plans for a national one.\nRelated: Plan to use Aboriginal land as a nuclear waste dump is flawed and misguided | Dave Sweeney\nWith the commission’s atomic waste agenda and global waste aspirations unveiled, the issue now becomes one of politics, especially in this federal election year given the plan’s profound national implications and the critical need for bi-partisan support.\nPremier Weatherill has flagged increased engagement with the commonwealth government ahead of the commission’s final report on May 6. He has outlined that while the SA government does not currently have a fixed view he is “prepared to consider such a proposition” and will provide a full response to the state parliament before the end of the year.\nUnlike the global nuclear power sector which is dying out due to growing public opposition and costs and the rise of renewables, nuclear waste is like zombie waste – it remains undead.\nThe stage is now set for a public debate and a community choice as to whether the options are really so scarce that South Australia’s and Australia’s best future economic chance is dependent on hosting the world’s worst environmental waste.",
